# REPORT OF CENSORSHIP REVIEW COMMITTEE 2010
The following is a summary from [the PDF version of the report](https://www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/imda/files/regulations-and-licensing/regulations/frameworks-and-policies/content-standards-and-classification/consultation-with-committees/crc_2010_report.pdf).

One of the interesting pointers here is for the recommendation of a server-level filtering service for content controlled by Internet Service Providers. More information on this is in [2014 Internet Parental Controls report](2014-internet-parental-controls.md).

## Overview

Taking note of the various viewpoints, the CRC has proposed about 80 key principles and recommendations hinged on the following five main themes:

1. **Greater freedom with greater responsibility** - both on the part of artists and media industry players, and on the part of parents
2. **Evolution from top-down to tripartite collaboration** - involving regulators, industry and the community
3. **Co-regulation** - regulatory responsibility shared with industry players should be encouraged wherever appropriate
4. **Parental empowerment** - parents must be empowered with sufficient information and simple tools to guide their children's exposure to content, supported by systematic school programmes
5. **Improved resourcing and transparency** - address under-resourcing of media regulation and accelerate regulatory transparency and public involvement

## Key Recommendations Summary

### Public Education
- A sustained, consistent and up-to-date cyberwellness programme should be incorporated as a compulsory element in the curriculum of all primary and secondary school students.

### Parental Empowerment and Informed Adult Choice
- Parents can be better empowered with tools such as an optional Internet filter and easy-to-use parental lock systems for the Internet and TV
- Rating systems should be harmonized where possible so that even an occasional user can intuitively grasp the implications of a rating
- Advisories should be more detailed and specific to guide consumer choice
- The MDA is encouraged to experiment with new information portals and user-driven services

### Engaging the Community
- Strengthen the role of the various citizen committees advising MDA and allow for direct nominations by the public for appointment to these committees
- Further develop the existing MDA online database to provide the community with more information on regulatory processes, survey findings and policy reviews, including an enhanced forum for public feedback and discussion
- Tap the ideas and hear the aspirations and concerns of young Singaporeans by adding a youth panel to the range of the MDA's citizen committees

### Engaging the Industry
- Improve the channels for dialogue with artists and media industry sectors
- Explore more avenues for co-regulation, including:
  - Term-licensing for arts groups (subject to agreed criteria) which would remove the need for pre-vetting of scripts
  - Allow video distributors to self-certify G and PG content

### Film and Video Classification System
- A **PG13 rating** should be introduced to provide a clearer signal to parents on the nature of content and to facilitate a more appropriate rating of films with more mature content
- Harmonize ratings across platforms

### New Media
- Replace the current symbolic 100-website ban with a transparent server-level filtering service to protect children
- Combined with a simple and well-highlighted choice to opt in at the point of subscribing to, or renewing, Internet services

### R21 Content on Various Platforms
- Where consumers have the ability to exercise controlled choice (e.g., Video-on-Demand), R21 content should be permitted
- Introduction should be carefully calibrated, and only allowed if there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent access by minors

### Arts Entertainment
- Implement term licensing for established arts groups
- Review and broaden the categories of arts entertainment exempted from licensing
- For performances targeted at niche audiences (e.g., ticketed poetry recitals), explore co-regulation through an online declaration system for content

## Detailed Recommendations

### Internet and the Future Media Landscape

1. The MDA should undertake an in-depth expert-led study to design and eventually implement a robust and consistent regulatory framework applicable to any new media forms, clear and transparent to both industry and consumers.

2. Classification systems and content standards governing different media platforms should be harmonised wherever possible so consumers can better understand and utilise ratings for informed decisions.

3. Existing content codes governing broadcast services should be extended to mobile-only content services. Content freely accessible to all mobile service subscribers only via mobile devices (not via Internet) should be subject to free-to-air (FTA) TV content standards.

4. Content offered on a subscription/on-demand basis to mobile service subscribers only via mobile devices (not via Internet) should be subject to subscription TV/Video-on-demand (VOD) standards.

5. The symbolic 100-website ban imposed by the government should be replaced with a transparent, server-level filtering service, combined with a simple and well-highlighted choice to opt in at the point of subscribing to or renewing Internet service.

6. Government should retain its power to ban websites on grounds of national security. However, checks should be put in place to ensure transparency and accountability of such government actions.

7. Public education efforts on media literacy and cyberwellness should be enhanced to ensure the public is equipped with updated information and knowledge to deal with emergence of new media forms and attendant evolution of media regulations.

### Public Education

8. A sustained cyberwellness programme for all primary and secondary students, consistent across all schools, should be incorporated into the curriculum by MOE. Such a programme should be made compulsory for all schools.

9. Schools should continue to engage the services of community groups for additional cyberwellness initiatives.

10. A single, permanent and properly resourced body should be tasked to oversee and coordinate all media literacy and cyberwellness programmes across ministries.

### Parental Empowerment

11. The aggregating body of public education efforts should work with the National Family Council (NFC) to strategise, coordinate and implement effective outreach programmes for parents.

12. There should be greater promotion of tools such as Internet filters, parental lock mechanisms, and media classification systems through public education.

13. If R21 content is introduced on subscription channels and VOD, operators should set parental locks on by default.

14. The MDA should simplify the nomenclature of ratings across all classification systems to facilitate intuitive understanding.

15. For FTA TV and pay-TV programmes, the classification advisory logos should be displayed on screen for the entire duration of the programme.

16. Classification advisories should be accompanied by consumer advice in press/publication/website programme listings as well as during programme introduction.

### Engaging the Community

17. Progressively move towards a tripartite engagement involving regulator, community and industry.

18. More resources should be devoted to facilitate deeper engagement with the community and industry.

19. A youth panel should be set up to reach out to the younger generation by communicating and garnering their views on content and media issues.

20. Emphasise public consultation as an essential process in policy and regulatory reviews.

21. Increase transparency of regulatory processes by increasing information made available to the public, including developing a database of public complaint cases and publication of survey findings, policy reviews and content guidelines.

22. Evaluation and measurement mechanisms should be developed to track the success of community engagement efforts.

23. Improve transparency of membership selection process for citizen committees advising MDA. MICA to take the lead in drawing up principles, objectives and criteria to guide nomination and appointment process.

24. Broaden public participation by allowing public nomination for a proportion of advisory committee positions. MDA to have a correspondingly reduced role in direct selection to enhance committees' independence and credibility.

25. Increase industry representation on citizen committees for better sharing of insights and concerns.

26. Eventually distance MDA from selection of appeal committee members since the latter considers appeals against MDA's decisions.

27. The Broadcasting, Publications and Arts Appeal Committee should be given final decision-making power to align with the Films Appeal Committee.

### Engaging the Industry

28. Regular formal consultations with industry should be introduced to provide a framework/channel for industry to propose changes to policies and guidelines.

29. Promote greater Industry-Community dialogue and interactions.

30. Increase representation of industry practitioners on content advisory committees.

31. Industry practitioners should be allowed to make direct representations to advisory committees.

32. An inclusive term licensing scheme for arts entertainment should be introduced expeditiously.

33. An online self-declaration system for niche arts performances should be introduced so such performances do not have to go through pre-vetting.

34. Co-regulation of video content up to PG13 rating should be introduced.

35. Industry should support the regulatory framework and be encouraged to assist in ensuring greater compliance.

36. Industry should be encouraged to participate in setting up and maintaining a community-wide focused online media portal.

37. For mediums not mandated to provide consumer advice (e.g., audio recordings), industry players should be encouraged to voluntarily provide consumer advice on explicit and mature content.

### Principles of Classification Framework

38. A simple, consistent and, where possible, harmonised framework for classification should be adopted to better guide parents in making media choices.

39. The Film Classification System should be used as a reference standard for other media.

40. The labellings on ratings for the Film Classification System should be reviewed to make it more intuitively understood by the public.
