## Part 1: Introduction

### 1.2 Background
Since 23 February 2012, Internet Access Service Providers ("IASPs") are required under the Class Licence to:
- Inform and offer optional Internet filtering services to subscribers at the point of subscription or renewal of fixed-line residential Internet access subscriptions
- This requirement was extended to cover mobile Internet access subscriptions from 30 June 2012
- Provide reasonable technical support to subscribers for the duration of their subscriptions

**Intent**: Increase parents' awareness of the availability of Internet filtering services and make it easier for them to subscribe, particularly parents with children aged 16 years and below.

> Please refer to Annex A for the relevant Class Licence conditions.

### 1.3 Observations from Focus Groups
MDA has observed from recent focus group discussions with parents:
- Most were generally still **unaware** of the availability of Internet filtering services
- Take-up of such services continued to be **low**
- Subscription **cost** was a factor
- With the prevalence of multiple devices in the home, there has been feedback that **network-level Internet filters** would be preferable (relieving parents from individually installing filters on each device)
- However, offering such network-level Internet filters is currently **not common** among local IASPs

### 1.4 International Developments
Recent developments in Europe where industry or Government has taken a more proactive approach:

| Region | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **European Commission** (CEO Coalition) | Suggested deployment of an "active choice" mechanism where users are required to make a choice on whether to subscribe to Internet parental controls upon first use of a device |
| **United Kingdom** | Advocated for ISPs to have Internet parental controls **switched on by default** to filter certain categories of content, unless an adult chooses to turn it off |

MDA also noted that ISPs in these countries generally offer Internet parental controls **free of charge** to subscribers.

> **Note**: Internet filtering solutions are increasingly referred to as "Internet parental controls," as they come with additional tools such as:
> - Time controls for Internet access
> - Activity logs
> - Alerts for attempted access to filtered content
>
> For the purpose of this consultation, MDA will use the term "Internet parental controls" in place of "Internet filters."

Parents have **discretion** to specify the content categories to be filtered.
