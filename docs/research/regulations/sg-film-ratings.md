## Media Classification Database
The [Media Classification Database](https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/classification/) provides classification information on films, video games and arts entertainment events, to help members of the public in Singapore make informed choices on media consumption.

- **Films and Videos**: Use the Films Classification Database to search for the age ratings and consumer advice of feature films, documentaries, serials, karaoke or music compilations.
- **Video Games**: Use the Video Games Classification Database to search for the age ratings and consumer advice of video games.
- **Arts**: Use the Arts Classification Database to search for ratings and content advisories for specific play titles of theatre performances, and arts events.
- **Registered Importers**: Registered Importers can use the Registered Importers Database to search for informations on magazines, books and comics, and audio materials.

### Video Games Classification
The [Video Games Classification](https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/classification/Search/VideoGames/Default.aspx) system (not sure why there's two pages but also accessible [here](https://iris.imda.gov.sg/databases/video-games)) is made up of the:
- **Advisory 16** (Suitable for 16 and Above) and;
- **M18** (Restricted to Persons Aged 18 and Above) ratings

Titles that are under ‘General’ need not carry any rating stickers. Consumers, especially parents, can make use of the classification information to make an informed choice on whether the game is appropriate for their children or younger audiences. 

Video games that were released before the introduction of Video Games Classification in April 2008 will not carry a rating and will simply be listed with "Accepted" in the Consumer Advice.

Other than the classification, the database also includes "Consumer Advice" notes, such as:
- Mature Content
- Suitable for 16 & Above
- Violence
- Mature Themes, Violence and Coarse Language
- Strong Violence and Gore

It covers the following platforms:

## Censorship Review Commitees
The Censorship Review Committee (CRC) reviews censorship laws and structures, and the role of public education. They also provide recommendations on existing policies and guidelines to keep pace with social and technological changes.

It is good to review the reports from these committees to understand criteria used for classification and censorship, including shifting definitions of what is appropriate for children and young audiences (i.e. what is violence, gore, etc).

Details are provided in the [2010 Censorship Review Committee](2010-censorship-review-committee.md) and [2003 Censorship Review Committee](2003-censorship-review-committee.md) reports.

### Gaps Identified
- There are NO ratings for **MOBILE GAMES** or **WEB-BASED GAMES**
- Controversial games like Roblox are not in the database, Fortnite is classified as General
- Consultative panels DO NOT comprise of mental health and child development experts, and hence likely do not consider the developmental needs and affects of children and young audiences
