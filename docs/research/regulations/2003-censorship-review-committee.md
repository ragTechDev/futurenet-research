# REPORT OF CENSORSHIP REVIEW COMMITTEE 2003
The following contains relevant excerpts from the [PDF version of the report](https://www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/imda/files/regulations-and-licensing/regulations/frameworks-and-policies/content-standards-and-classification/consultation-with-committees/public_consultation-with-committees_crc2003.pdf).

# Broad Summary
-  the Censorship Review Committee has held 22 meetings and met with more than 150 people representing 13 focus groups. The Committee also commissioned a representative survey of about 1,000 respondents to gauge the public’s attitudes and views on censorship issues
-  Protecting the young by applying stricter standards for content that is easily accessible by them, introducing consumer advice and promoting parental guidance
- the responsibility to guide and control will have to be increasingly borne by the individual, the public, particularly parents, and the industry. While the regulator may define and regulate sensitive areas like race and religion, in the areas of morality, the responsibility will have to be devolved to the public and citizen advisory committees
- Suggests adopting a tetrapartite formula involving the regulators, industry players, community and the artists. All the four parties need to be pro-actively involved in the censorship process if Singapore wants to develop into a vibrant Renaissance City without sacrificing its core values

## 3. MANAGING ACCESS

3.1 Access management principally consists of classification, zoning, belting and other regulatory measures.

### Classification

3.2 This is the most common censorship tool used by countries in allocating content according to its suitability for the different age groups. The content standards allocated to each age restriction in a classification model, however, differ from country to country largely due to respective social and cultural conditions. In some countries, the age guideline is enforced, but in others it only serves as an advisory.

3.3 Classification is used largely for mediums that are easily classifiable and have wide impact, like films and videos. It is not normally used for mediums that have a high circulation volume and with a time-sensitive market, like daily newspapers and sound recordings.

3.4 Classification is also done through other measures like:
- Restricting the sale of a particular publication through subscription
- Wrapping to prevent unsolicited viewing
- Displaying consumer advice on its cover about its sensitive content

### Zoning

3.5 Zoning normally refers to confining the access of a particular content to a specific location. An example of this is the current policy of allowing the screening of R(A) films only in cinemas outside HDB estates.

### Belting

3.6 Belting refers to confining screening or broadcast time of a particular sensitive content to either late at night or early in the morning to keep it away from unintended viewers, like children.

## 4.11 INTERNET

### Light-touch Approach

4.11.1 The popularity of the Internet has continued to grow unabated. With faster speed and better compression technology in the future, the Internet is rapidly evolving into a broadcast medium with the ability to deliver rich multimedia content.

4.11.2 Currently, MDA regulates the Internet through a licensing scheme and the Internet Code of Practice, which is a set of MDA guidelines for the industry players to observe. This CRC agrees with the light-touch approach adopted for the Internet, considering the business costs of a prescriptive approach.

4.11.3 However, more can be done to promote industry responsibility over this area, particularly in the areas of Code of Conduct and Content Rating:
- The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should develop and voluntarily subscribe to Industry Codes of Conduct, which could eventually replace the MDA guidelines
- The UK Home Office's Good Practice Models and Guidance for the Internet is a good example of such a code of conduct
- Internet Content Providers (ICPs) who operate their own websites should label and rate their online content using any reputable Internet classification system available, such as that used by the Internet Content Rating Agency, based in Geneva

### Family Access Network

4.11.4 MDA works with the three main ISPs in Singapore to provide Family Access Network (FAN) services. These networks filter out pornographic and other undesirable sites to help parents manage their children's Internet access. The take-up rate for FAN, however, remains low.

4.11.5 To address this:
- The existing ISPs should be encouraged to speed up the development of user-friendly filtering features for parents within the next two years, with support from MDA in research and development
- The system should also be marketed extensively by the ISPs
- If the industry does not devote sufficient effort to develop an appropriate system, MDA should impose other measures to protect the young from harmful content

### 100 Banned Websites

4.11.6 The symbolic ban on the list of 100 websites has attracted international attention. It has served as a symbolic statement on the kind of content unacceptable to society. The 100 banned sites should be updated to include other harmful content such as those which promote paedophilia and child pornography. This symbolic ban should remain until MDA or industry players find a viable alternative.

### Public Education

4.11.7 Regulation of the Internet is currently supported by the Parents Advisory Group for the Internet (PAGi). In addition to parents, a special multi-agency task force involving government, industry players and parents or civic groups should be set up by MDA to spearhead a high-profile, wide-ranging and sustained public education programme to inculcate a sound Net culture among users in Singapore.

4.11.8 The multi-agency task force could develop programmes to impart to our youths not just technical knowledge about the Internet but also the capacity to handle its content. Government support will be needed in particular, for a cyber youth mentoring programme that teaches youths to be responsible and discerning users of the medium.

### Recommendations

- Continue with light-touch regulation.
- Update the symbolic ban on the 100 websites to include sites with other harmful content such as paedophilia and child pornography. This symbolic ban will remain until MDA finds a viable alternative.
- Internet Content Providers should label their websites using any reputable international content rating system.
- Internet Service Providers should develop and subscribe to a code of conduct and put greater effort in protecting the young by developing an effective filtering system within a period of two years. Otherwise MDA should impose other effective measures.
- MDA should set up a multi-agency task force to study the inculcation of appropriate Net culture among the young through public education programmes.

## 5.1 ASPECTS OF CONTENT

The content discussed in this section covers:
- Race and religion
- Moral values
- Homosexuality
- Violence
- Sexual content and nudity
- Coarse language
- Chinese dialects (a peculiarly Singaporean issue)

---

## 5.2 CONTENT DISALLOWED

It is difficult to enforce content guidelines on mediums such as the Internet. Nevertheless, the following guidelines for content standards should still be applicable to all mediums:

1. Should not undermine public order and the nation's security
2. Should not denigrate race and religion
3. Should not erode the core moral values of society, through content such as:
   - Pornography
   - Deviant sexual practices
   - Sexual violence
   - Child pornography
   - Bestiality

**Recommendation:**
> Continue to disallow content that undermines public order and the nation's security, denigrates race and religion or erodes moral values through pornography, deviant sexual practices, sexual violence, child pornography, bestiality, etc.

---

## 5.3 RACE AND RELIGION

- Content that denigrates any race or religion should continue to be disallowed
- As a long-term strategy, there is a need to gradually enlarge the common space for discussion of these sensitive issues through the various mediums to help promote greater understanding, tolerance and harmony among the different segments of our society
- Disagreements on the appropriate line to draw cannot be totally avoided
- Such matters should continue to be resolved through the existing consultation process led by the advisory and the appeal committees representing various segments of society
- Members of these committees should function in their individual capacity, in order to maintain objectivity and to serve the common good of ordinary Singaporeans
- Where necessary, there should be consultation with the relevant religious groups

**Recommendations:**
> - Continue to disallow content that denigrates any race or religion
> - Gradually enlarge common space for discussion of racial and religious issues through the various mediums, as a long-term approach in fostering racial and religious understanding and harmony

---

## 5.4 MORAL VALUES

- In Singapore's context, censorship plays a role in fostering a morally wholesome and socially cohesive society
- It helps safeguard core community values such as:
  - The importance of the family
  - Respect for one's elders
  - Moral integrity
- We have to strike a balance between allowing individuals more space for creativity and maintaining moral standards
- Importing norms from societies that are culturally different from us would not work for our society

**Recommendation:**
> Continue to strike a balance between allowing more space for creativity and maintaining moral standards

---

## 5.5 HOMOSEXUALITY

### Current Approach
- MDA takes a cautious approach towards homosexual content, even though the CRC 1992 allowed it, if not promotional in nature
- Publications and arts entertainment, unlike films, are given greater leeway in dealing with homosexual issues as their impact is either on individuals or on smaller audience sizes
- Films dealing with homosexual themes and scenes in a non-exploitative or non-promotional manner are allowed only at the Singapore International Film Festival (SIFF) but not for commercial release

### Calls for Change
- Some sectors, especially arts groups, have called for greater space for content on homosexuality, especially in films
- They have requested for the same treatment given to SIFF to be given for commercial screening, with *Lan Yu* being the most notable example

### Survey Findings
- Censorship surveys have shown that half the respondents did not object to allowing access to non-exploitative content dealing with homosexuality
- Similar sentiment was also expressed by most participants at this CRC's focus group discussions
- Nevertheless, it is still a sensitive subject in our society
- Some segments hold the view that allowing content on homosexuality in the public domain will be taken as an endorsement by the authorities

### Committee Position
- As a matter of principle, a decision made by the authorities to allow depiction of certain lifestyles or values under content guidelines should not mean official endorsement for the content
- Consumers should exercise their judgement and take responsibility for their choice
- There is a need for public education on this matter
- Content with homosexual themes or scenes should be given greater leeway for adults, so long as they are not exploitative
- MDA should give greater consideration to factors like artistic merit of a content and whether a scene is relevant to the context

**Recommendations:**
> - Take a more flexible and contextual approach when dealing with homosexual themes and scenes in content
> - Allow greater leeway for adults, through suitable channels, to access such content provided it is not exploitative

---

## 5.6 VIOLENCE

### Context
- The wide availability of media content with a high level of violence, including some children's comics, is common to Asian societies
- While there is still no conclusive link between a high level of violence in mediums and a high crime rate, there have been periodic concerns in the West over the linkage between the two, most recently after the school killings in the US
- These have resulted in calls for tightening violent content, especially in their respective domestic TV
- The US Federal Trade Commission recently called for a tightening of violence in video games, films and videos and controls over their promotion and advertising, after the shooting incidents in schools

### Focus Group Feedback
- Participants at focus group discussions have also called for a tightening of violence in content meant for children, especially in TV programmes, and for more consumer advice
- Films such as *The Patriot*, *Gladiator* and *We Were Soldiers* should have been given a higher rating

### Committee Position
- MDA should give higher ratings or require late hour TV broadcast for content with strong violence or elements of torture
- MDA should also tighten the sale of children's comics with strong violence

**Recommendation:**
> Impose stricter standards for content with strong violence or elements of torture, targeting the young through higher ratings, late hour belting, control of sale and provision of consumer advice

---

## 5.7 SEXUAL CONTENT AND NUDITY

### Current Approach
- MDA is relatively strict with the depiction of sex and nudity in the various mediums:
  - *Sex and the City* is not allowed for Cable TV broadcast
  - *Playboy* is banned
  - Explicit sex scenes are edited from R(A) films
- Some segments of our society are critical of such a conservative position, which contrasts with MDA's relatively liberal treatment towards violence

### Committee Position
- Although some may not find content depicting sex and nudity offensive, censorship should also consider the views of those who feel differently
- We need to strike a balance between these two opposing views
- With the access controls in place, greater leeway should be accorded to depiction of non-exploitative sex and nudity targeting adults
- Greater weightage should also be given to the relevance of the scenes to the context
- This CRC recommends:
  - Lifting the ban on magazines such as *Cosmopolitan*
  - Allowing programmes such as *Sex and the City*
  - Such content can be made available through suitable distribution channels to prevent unsolicited viewing and protect the young
- Content that does not meet the general guidelines of MDA should still be disallowed
- Regarding *Playboy* magazine: our community is not ready for its liberal use of sexually explicit photographs

### Public Space
- While allowing adults greater leeway in sexual content and nudity, MDA should continue to impose stricter control on the use of such content in public space, such as:
  - Public billboards
  - Video walls
  - Advertising materials
  - General public performances
  - Covers of magazines and newspapers
- Media owners and advertisers should exercise restraint when such content is intended for public space, easily accessible to the young

**Recommendations:**
> - Allow greater leeway to non-exploitative sex and nudity relevant to the context in content for adults. But, continue to impose stricter standards for such content in public space
> - Allow adults access to magazines such as *Cosmopolitan* and programmes such as *Sex and the City* through suitable distribution channels

## 5.8 COARSE LANGUAGE

### Current Approach
- Coarse language is not a major censorship issue with MDA which has been relatively liberal towards it in sound recordings and imported films
- MDA adopts a stricter standard with coarse language in local films and the broadcast media, because of their greater impact on local audiences

### Committee Position
- Content with strong coarse language should be placed in appropriate higher ratings to protect the young
- The same content standard should also be applied to coarse language in local and foreign content, taking into consideration the impact

**Recommendations:**
> - Impose a stricter standard for coarse language in content, especially those for the young
> - Apply the same standard for coarse language in local and foreign content, taking into consideration the impact
