## Mission
For families, k-ID creates safer, more empowering online experiences for kids and teens—no matter where they are or what platform they’re on.

We believe that protecting kids and teens isn’t about limiting their freedom—it’s about helping them discover what’s possible through age-appropriate design. Our technology adapts experiences to match a child’s age and stage, respecting their privacy while supporting their independence. Whether it’s managing parental consent and permissions, enabling safe play, or connecting families across platforms, k-ID makes the digital world safer, more empowering, and built for kids to thrive and grow.

For businesses and developers, k-ID delivers seamless age assurance, parental consent, and a powerful infrastructure to create and scale age-appropriate experiences globally.

Our solution helps platforms dynamically adapt their services to different age groups and legal requirements—enabling more relevant, compliant, and trusted user experiences without adding complexity or friction. With flexible integration options and global regulatory alignment built in, k-ID makes it easier to serve younger audiences responsibly, while building trust with families, partners, and regulators alike.

## Solution
A suite of tools for developers and families to empower kids and teens to use the Internet safely. k-ID enables games and applications to be compliant world-wide by providing jurisdiction-specific data from a comprehensive database of regulations to drive game behavior in 200+ markets. There are five main components in k-ID:

### KnowledgeKit
An always-up-to-date compliance database containing privacy & safety laws across 240+ jurisdictions (195+ countries, 22,000+ sources)

### [Compliance Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.k-id.com/cdk/overview)
The k-ID Compliance Development Kit (CDK) is an enterprise-grade compliance framework that automatically manages regulatory logic and compliance settings. It intelligently determines which features and content are accessible to players based on their age, jurisdiction, and parental consent status.

CDK provides two integration options:

1. Widgets: Pre-built widgets that handle the complete compliance flow in iframes, including age gate, Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC), data notices, and permission management. Developers can build a custom age gate using the k-ID API directly, but it you're using the k-ID embedded widget, the UX is already handled for you.
