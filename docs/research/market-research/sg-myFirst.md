## History
In 2017, the spark for myFirst ignited unexpectedly from a simple father-daughter moment. Our Founder & CEO G-Jay Yong found inspiration when his two-year-old daughter insisted on taking pictures with his Canon DSLR. Concerned about the weight of the 2kg camera, G-Jay set out to find a digital alternative that would match his daughter’s enthusiasm.

To his surprise, the market offered no suitable solution. It was from this realization that led G-Jay to establish and the myFirst Camera was swiftly introduced, marking the beginning of a tech journey designed specifically for children. Thus, Ru Faye received her first ever camera and the myFirst KidsTech ecosystem was born.

It was not long after the launch of myFirst Camera that myFirst became the #1 Kid’s Camera Brand in South Korea. Driven by a larger vision to be the first touchpoint for tech products in children’s lives, myFirst has since diversified its offerings. With nearly 10 device categories, including watchphones, cameras, earbuds, 3D pens, sketch boards, and headphones, myFirst products are now available in over 36 countries.

Since, G-Jay and our team of “Super Dads” continue to embrace the entrepreneurial spirit, coupled with a commitment to enhancing children’s interaction with technology, which has propelled myFirst into a global phenomenon. The need for their kids to engage more with new technology as the world is developing is more apparent than ever. The brand continues to thrive, connecting with families around the world and creating innovative, kid-friendly tech experiences for the next generation.
