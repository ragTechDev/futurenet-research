## France
Since 2010, France banned the use of phones in classes. In 2018, this was extended to
break, lunchtimes and school trips. There are exemptions for students with disabilities or if
phones are needed for specific reasons (eg medical condition monitoring).

In 2024, a committee appointed by the President explored the available evidence of screen
use in childhood and made recommendations. The following information is taken from
English news sites as the report is in French.42,43
The report, “In Search of Lost Time” acknowledged the advantages of technology in
childhood but stated that "we must adopt a truthful discourse to describe the reality of
children's excessive online connections and the consequences for their health, development,
future, and also for our own future".
The report stated that children needed to be protected from the technology industry’s profitdriven “strategy of capturing children’s attention, using all forms of cognitive bias to shut
children away on their screens, control them, re-engage them and monetise them”.
The report made the following recommendations:
• Phones and screens should be limited as much as possible on maternity wards to
help parents bond with their babies.
• Parents should be helped to avoid what they called “techno-ference” – when parents
constantly checking their own phones interfered with their ability concentrate on
talking to, eating with or playing with their children.
• Phone use should be addressed among childminders.
• Advised against exposing under-threes to screens.
• For children up to the age of six, screens of all kinds should be “strongly limited” and
only very rarely used for education content when sitting with an adult.
• Banning connected toys, except those used as audio for storytelling.
• Screens should be banned from nursery schools for children under six.
• In primary schools, children should not be given individual tablets or digital devices
to work on, unless it was for a specific disability.
• Waiting until age 11 for a cellphone (just a handset, no access to the internet).
• Waiting until age 13 for a phone with internet access and only access to certain sites.
• A 15-year-old should be able to access only what the report called “ethical” social
media, such as Mastodon. Conventional, mass-marketed, profit-driven social media
such as TikTok, Instagram or Snapchat should not be available to teenagers until
they reached 18.
