## Background
Jasmine is a working parent juggling family routines, school communications, and device access negotiations at home. She cares deeply about her child’s wellbeing but does not feel confident navigating fast-changing online risks, apps, and settings.

She generally assumes that “common sense” rules and occasional check-ins are sufficient, and she may only revisit online safety after hearing about incidents, bans, or news headlines.

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Keep her child safe online without becoming overly restrictive or controlling
- Build confidence that she is doing “enough” as a parent, even if she’s not very technical
- Avoid household conflict and prolonged device battles while still setting boundaries

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Low awareness of what she “doesn’t know” about online risks and how quickly they change
- Parental controls exist but feel confusing, time-consuming, or easy to misconfigure, so she under-uses them
- Motivation spikes only after external triggers (school incident, media coverage), then fades due to daily busyness

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Plain-language guidance with minimal jargon | Parents disengage when materials feel “technical” or condescending; they need clear, actionable steps |
| “Start young” pathways for the 10–12 and 13–15 transition | These ages get more independence online and are more likely to interact with strangers or drift into risky spaces |
| Low-friction routines and checklists (not one-off lectures) | Parents need sustainable habits that fit into real life, not idealized parenting behavior |

---

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Personally moderate; child usage is the primary concern and a common source of conflict |
| Favorite activities | Relies on parent chat groups, school updates, and quick web searches for parenting tips |
| Communication behavior | Prefers short, digestible content (workshops, toolkits, summaries) rather than long manuals |
| Attention span | Limited bandwidth; engages best with concrete examples, visuals, and interactive formats |

---

## Emotional Considerations
Jasmine may feel guilt or anxiety when she realizes she is behind on online safety knowledge, especially after exposure to new terms, risks, or stories. She is reassured by non-judgmental framing, practical next steps, and a sense that improvement is possible without drastic measures.

She can feel overwhelmed by:
- Too many settings and options without prioritization
- Materials that sound preachy, alarmist, or condescending
- Changes that cause immediate household friction (e.g., sudden device removal)

## Quotes (if interview based)
> “Parents won’t pay for online safety solutions.”

> “7% of parents actually use the parental controls in a useful way.”

> “If I started charging for my webinar, no one would attend.”

> “They still dunno what they dunno.”

> “Huge disconnect from our parents. We need a new parenting style.”

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Success
FutureNet is successful for this persona if:
- [ ] Jasmine can set up 1–2 high-impact safety controls (or routines) within 15–30 minutes without feeling lost
- [ ] Jasmine understands the top 3 risks relevant to her child’s age (10–12 / 13–15) and knows what to do next
- [ ] Jasmine can have calmer, more consistent conversations about online behavior without escalating into repeated battles
