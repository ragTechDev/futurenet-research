## Background
Mika is a parent who wants her child to gain independence safely as she starts walking to elementary school. She is cautious about the negative effects of smartphones and social media on children and tries to keep home life relatively screen-free.

She chose a Japanese “kids keitai” (a child-focused phone) because it supports essential communication and safety (calls, messaging, GPS) without open internet/apps. She actively configures geofences and safety alerts and follows local school norms (phone stays in the child’s bag during school hours).

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Delay smartphone adoption for as long as possible without sacrificing safety.
- Ensure reliable communication with her child during commuting and after-school time.
- Keep her child’s attention and social development grounded in real-world play (minimize screen babysitting).

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Smartphones feel hard to “truly” lock down; parental controls can be bypassed.
- Limited parental administration model (only one admin); wants both caregivers to have full control.
- Cannot remotely manage the phone (e.g., if child turns volume down, parent may not be able to reach them).
- Safety setup overhead and constraints (e.g., limited number of geofence/Wi‑Fi gateway slots).
- Alternative devices (walkie-talkie/speaker trackers) have latency and feel less dependable for urgent communication.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| App-free / “closed” experience by default | Prevents exposure to social media, addictive content, strangers, and peer-pressure loops. |
| Safety-first location features (geofence, alerts, anomaly detection) | Enables independence (walking to school) while reducing parental anxiety. |
| Multi-caregiver admin roles | Both parents/guardians need visibility and control without hacks/workarounds. |
| Age-based “upgrade path” (kids → pre-teen → teen) | Device should mature in look/utility without opening the door to high-risk social apps too early. |
| Reliable contactability safeguards | Parents need confidence calls/messages get through (e.g., missed calls due to silent/volume). |

---

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Keeps child screen exposure limited; occasional parent-phone use at restaurants; limited gaming time (e.g., ~20 min on Switch). |
| Favorite activities | Child: photos/videos on kids phone; outdoor play. Parent: researching/optimizing safety setup; sharing learnings online. |
| Communication behavior | Prefers voice/audio when typing is hard for child; uses SMS/calls for day-to-day coordination. |
| Attention span | Values tools that don’t encourage endless scrolling; wants “communication, not entertainment.” |

---

## Emotional Considerations
Mika feels reassured when the system is transparent, predictable, and clearly limited in scope (no hidden apps, no internet, clear safety alerts). She feels overwhelmed or distrustful when products claim “parental controls” but still leave loopholes.

## Quotes (if interview based)
> “Even if you put parental guard, kids could make their way around it.”

> “From begining were a relatively screen free family for kids.”

> “Kids phone is not entertainment.”

- [ ] Her child can commute and attend after-school activities with reliable check-ins and location confidence.
- [ ] The product reduces the need to give a full smartphone “just for GPS.”
- [ ] The experience stays closed/app-free while still feeling age-appropriate as the child grows.
