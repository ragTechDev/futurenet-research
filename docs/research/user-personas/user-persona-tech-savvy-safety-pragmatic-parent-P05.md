# User Persona – Tech-Savvy Safety-Pragmatic Parent (P05)

## Basic Profile
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Name | Tech-Savvy Safety-Pragmatic Parent (P05) |
| Age | 30s |
| School Level | University-educated professional (software engineer) |
| Tech Proficiency | High (iOS ecosystem, parental controls, tracking devices; informed about online platform incentives) |
| Location / Community | Singapore, children in MOE primary school system |

## Background
Mother of two children (around **6** and **9**) in Singapore. Works as a software engineer and is comfortable with technology (and games), but is strongly skeptical of modern engagement-driven platforms.

Kids primarily use iPads for structured learning (including online classes), with tightly limited entertainment use. This parent has experienced first-hand how indirect exposure can happen through peers (friends with phones, older kids at playground), and she feels the gap between “what I control at home” and “what happens in the real world.”

She is not ideologically anti-tech: she believes children eventually need exposure and skills to handle digital risks. Her approach is **graduated exposure** with clear boundaries, plus strong preference for stable, low-friction tools (often within Apple’s ecosystem).

## Goals & Motivations
- Keep children safe from harmful content, predatory behavior, and manipulation by algorithms/ads.
- Introduce communication tools (calls/text) for real-world safety and coordination as kids gain independence (e.g., commuting, after-school classes).
- Maintain a strong relationship of trust so kids disclose incidents instead of hiding them.
- Prioritize high-quality, less over-stimulating content (prefers Netflix Kids over YouTube-style content; prefers paid games over free ones due to ads).
- Avoid making children social outcasts by completely isolating them from common tech experiences.

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Peer-driven exposure is unavoidable: children see memes/videos via friends even without having social media.
- Strong distrust of platforms branded “for kids” (e.g., YouTube Kids); sees incentives as exploitative.
- Hard tradeoffs in screen time enforcement: strict cutoffs reduce overuse but can feel unfair and damage trust.
- High anxiety around chat-enabled or UGC-heavy platforms (Roblox) due to predators and uncontrolled interactions.
- Real-world independence creates safety needs (child traveling alone; uncertainty when routes change).
- Wary of emerging AI chat products for young children; wants evidence and safeguards before adoption.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Graduated access controls (feature tiers) | Wants staged enablement (calls-only -> calls+text -> limited messaging) aligned to child maturity, not a single “on/off” switch. |
| Strong app and install restrictions (whitelist) | Wants to allow only approved apps; prevent self-installation and reduce exposure to algorithmic feeds. |
| Safer communication patterns for kids | Needs a child-appropriate way to communicate and socialize without the risks of open chat platforms. |
| Location safety with low friction | Wants reliable, low-battery, hard-to-circumvent location visibility for peace of mind. |
| Incident handling playbooks | Wants practical steps for kids to respond when exposed (report/block/dislike; talk to parent), building resilience over time. |
| Trust-centered tooling | Controls should support healthy parent-child trust (transparent monitoring expectations; review rhythms) rather than secret surveillance. |
| Ad-minimization and content quality curation | Prefers paid/ad-free options and high-quality content standards; wants to avoid “fast, overstimulating” content patterns. |
| Evidence-based AI safety stance | Would only consider AI features if well-tested, age-appropriate, and clearly bounded for children. |

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Devices at home | Kids use iPads; no personal phones. Parent uses iPhone/Apple Watch and prefers Apple ecosystem stability. |
| Screen use rules | Primarily for lessons; limited entertainment (e.g., weekly play). Parent monitors what is played/watched. |
| Content preferences | Netflix Kids preferred; avoids YouTube/YouTube Kids where possible; pays for YouTube Premium when needed to avoid ads. |
| Safety routines | Uses location tracking (e.g., AirTag in bag) to monitor commuting; values reliable, low-friction setup. |
| Parenting approach to tech | “Controlled exposure” rather than strict isolation; sees skill-building as necessary long-term. |

## Emotional Considerations
Feels **protective and concerned** about harms spreading through peer networks and open platforms, and **betrayed** by tech companies that optimize for engagement while claiming kid safety.

Also feels **pragmatic and determined**: prefers thoughtful guardrails, stable tools, and coaching children through incidents, rather than betting on perfect prevention.

## Quotes (if interview based)
> “memes and videos are like viruses, they live on in people’s heads”

> “would rather control the fire so i can control the damage”

> “for primary sch kids, dont think they have the right to privacy at the moment because they cant handle dangers by themselves”

> “ads are sewage”
