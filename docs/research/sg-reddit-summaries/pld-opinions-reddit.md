# Context on Personal Learning Devices

## Summary of Student Opinions from Reddit (r/SGExams)

**Source**: [Reddit thread: "Thoughts on the PLD?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1g7r6iv/thoughts_on_the_pld/)  
**Context**: Discussion from students who have used PLDs for 4 years, responding to a Straits Times article about PLDs being distracting in classrooms.

## Key Themes from Student Feedback

### 1. Poor Device Management & Easily Bypassed Controls

**Mobile Guardian (MG) is ineffective**:
- **S1 implementation (2200 lockdown)**: Website blocking after 10pm was easily circumvented by loading YouTube videos in Google Docs
- **S2 implementation (fullscreen popup)**: Could be bypassed by putting the PLD on sleep mode for a few days, causing the popup to not appear
- **Inconsistent blocking**: discord.com was blocked but ptb.discord.com remained accessible for most of the year
- **Random blocking in final days**: ChatGPT, YouTube, Geogebra were suddenly blocked after 8pm under unfamiliar categories

**Easy to jailbreak**:
- Student witnessed a Secondary 1/2 student running Genshin Impact on their PLD
- Indicates technical controls are insufficient to prevent determined students from bypassing restrictions

**Student perspective**: "MG is quite poorly sanctioned" - controls are seen as ineffective and easily circumvented by tech-savvy students.

### 2. Quality & Durability Issues

**Hardware problems within 3 years**:
- **System performance**: Frequent lag when typing documents; audio playback stutters and repeats like "a broken recorder"
- **Screen degradation**: 
  - Bubbles form inside screen after 2 years with no way to remove them
  - Black bars appear at bottom of screen, progressively covering the whole screen
  - Described as "just like cancer"
- **Physical fragility**: Device body broke after being knocked off a desk by a classmate

**Cost-quality tension**:
- Student acknowledges the ~SGD 300 Chromebook is "really generous already given we're paying with edusave"
- However, expects better durability: "the computer cannot last more than 3 years"
- Repair limitations: Students get limited repair credits, making it difficult to fix multiple issues

**Student perspective**: "Unless you rarely touch the PLD, the computer cannot last more than 3 years."

### 3. Underutilization in Classroom

**Rarely used for meaningful learning**:
- "We rarely used the PLD" - many activities remain pen and paper
- When used, it's for "trivial things like Kahoot or group work on a Google Docs that we can do on the phone"
- No significant pedagogical advantage over existing tools

**School variation**:
- Student notes this may be specific to their school ("graduated from a trash school in the west")
- Suggests implementation quality varies significantly across schools

**Student perspective**: PLDs are not being leveraged effectively for learning, raising questions about the value proposition.

## Implications for Device Design

### What students are telling us:

1. **Bypassable controls are worse than no controls**: Students lose respect for restrictions that are easily circumvented, and it becomes a game to bypass them

2. **Durability matters for daily-use devices**: If students use devices regularly, they need to last the full 4-year secondary school period without major hardware failures

3. **Purpose and value must be clear**: If PLDs are used only for trivial tasks that could be done on phones, students question why they need a separate device

4. **Technical implementation quality varies**: School IT capabilities significantly impact the PLD experience

### Design considerations:

- **Bypass-resistant enforcement**: Controls need to be system-level and tamper-resistant, not easily circumvented workarounds
- **Build quality**: Devices for daily student use need better durability than consumer-grade Chromebooks
- **Clear pedagogical value**: PLDs should enable learning experiences that genuinely require the device, not just replicate what phones can do
- **Consistent implementation**: Success depends on school IT capacity and teacher training, not just the device itself
