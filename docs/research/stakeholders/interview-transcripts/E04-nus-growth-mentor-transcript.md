# Background of department
- NUS college is new, in the american sense, doing a parallel program on top of home degree
- Growth mentoring is a unqiyue offering for students
- Focuses on: 
  - 1) career guidance, career guidance that value adds to exising career guidance - center for future graduates 
  - 2) Life coaching and mentoring of students [New and unique offering]
- 2023 officiation

# Age group
- 18 to 26 years old
- 80% singaporean, 20% overseas
- undergraduate studies
- conscription policy hence later age group

# Career guidance
- special internship program
- interdisciplinary aspect
- make learning intentional
- ensure partners are able to provide interdiscipliunary aspect
- have agency in work they want to do
- CFG caters to larger NUS population
- Interdisciplinary: students get to work with classmates from other faculties
- Growth mentoring helps them to weave unique experiences for future careers; CFG doe snot offer

# Interdisciplinary Focus
- When someone applies to NUS, they get a choice to apply to NUS college
- Eg NUS School of Computing, but also do NUS college program which gives certain amount of credits
- Impact experience program - 2 year mod worth 8 credits, where they form project teams made up of students from NUS college students from different home faculties to do a social impact project
- Academic mods wise, they have to do specifically interdisciplinary mods
- Relatively new; Yale-NUS paved the way, new entitiy of NUs college came up from that 

# Why Interdisciplinary Focus?
- Traditional notions of career
- Started talking about a T-shaped education: do a specialization with home degree, but want you still to have broad base of knowledge and experiences --> got the idea of interdisciplinary education
- NUS college meant to give students a T-shaped education based, so they are relatively adaptable to workforce. Have understanding and exposure to different fields and work well with others
- "Pi" shaped experience
- Talk in industry to have a comb shaped skillset

# Digital Skills in Interdisciplinary
- MOE all guns firing into tech
- Implementation is still localized in schools
- Esp regarding AI use, some stnadardized learning management systems
- There;s no centralized framework
- Varying tech savviness across students
- Experience at high ed level
- This is the most tech savvy generation, growing up wiht software as they evolve
- Currently for profit software
- Not eveyrone has the same compute for GPTs, depending on purchasing powers and whether insitution subsidizes it
- The 'shapeshifters' are the ones who perform well in the workplace, adapt well to different software

# Needed skills
- Tech savviness doesn't equate to readiness, see that there are other skills that are needed on how tech ready they are
- Those who k now how to utilize software as a tool rather than as a solution, they are more versatile
- The ones who know how to talk, build relationships with people
- Over concentration on tech skills rather than focusing on fundamental core skills that interdisciplinarian education allows one to shine more on/practice
- Strong potential for NUS college to be a hub for interdisciplinary education
- Do not need tech to enahnce the experience, quite dichotomous, rennaissance student is the one who can allow all these things to intermingle

# 1. The need to develop skills int he use of tech

# 2. The impact of tech on student development
- MOE has been going in alot on cyber wellness and developing tech skills because we've seent he negative impact of tech esp during COVID period
- At level of university, we've seen an over reliance on tech when it comes to applying for jobs and applications, reates a false persona of sort
- As a result of using tech, they are losing personal skills required for the workplace

## False Persona
- Whatever students wrote in CV doesn't really represent who they are in person
- Advises student to be cognisant what they are applying for and to align their CV with who they are rather than what AI tells them to
- Have workshops that help them discover who they are 
- Students apply for opportunities on how far it wil bring them in life
- Workshops clarify what's important to them, align to their values

# Dunning-Kruger Effect
- At the young adult stage, Dunning-Kruger effect is highest
- Job as a mentor is not to prescribe what they should do, but to help them discover who they are
- That's the gem in mentoring
- Example: field trip to clan society - students who open themselves up to that discovery, to have risk appeitiote to exploration adn to do so as community, makes for a very rich learnign process
- Tech has to take a step aside, someone who is very hireable in life philosophy; whether they grapple well with tech is secondary
- This particular demographic, they're at a stage that they are forming an identity regardless of whether it is 2026 or 2000s
- The use of tech has excerbated and made things worse, not in the sense of self discovery, byut the use of tech has enable th estudents to create a flase persona which is harmful to them when they look for internships
- Tools like using AI to improve linkedin, writing applications or essays for submissions using AI
- Discovered that there is an increasing among of usage of students doign this
- Over-confidence - alot of anxiety and social media comparisons on how people have set their paths and chosen their careers
- Cause anxieties in students wanting to explore, but al of a suddent everyone seems to know what they want to know
- Causes them to make quick and rash decisions on opportunities - to try to optimize their choices so they can make the best out of things
- But as a young person optimizing things, it begs the question on what are you trying to optimize
- Don't need to go for this because I already know how it works
- To hear this from a young person, it does breed into sense of foolishness - start to take pride in the fact that I already know how it works - can be very detrimental to their growth and the way their networks grow overtime
- Know students who look on others with a sense of belittlement or supriority becuause there is this confidence they have their way set
- It is amplified when they enter industries and start to see how they are different from others
- End up with students who don't know why they have a second major or plus data science - everyone else is doing it, the flocking effect ie the lemming effect
- Think it is scary when too many are confident about what the future looks like - one of the most foolish mistakes

## Employer POV
- Switched increasingly to skill-based assessments to combat Ai use
- In traditional style will subnmit CV and cover letter, then maybe interview person
- But now looking at CV and cover letter doesn't do very much because of AI
- When I do interview, I prefer in person rather than online, because with an online one you can AI coach yourself
- Rather have in-person, and si an actuall skills-absed assessment in-person
- Have talked to career partners in different industries, they resonate too in job applkcation portion

# General Attitudes at the Workplace As a Result of Tech Development
- Online video conference tools like Google
- Because of COVID, the only interaction peple had esp students was totally online
- If it had an impact already on adults like us adapting it at work and our sense of identity and behaviours ar emore or less set and crystallized - imagine the impact on young adults who are still developing that identity
- At MOE HQ, the data we were getting very real social development impacts
- "Can we do a video interview instead?" - not just convenience, stems from a very real insecurity or lack of confidence to meet someone face to face
- Seeing that there's a general discomfort in real face to face interaction

## Marcus approach
- Friend-first approach: esp for in-residence mentor
- Taking part in different events to learn more about mentor
- When they are close enough, they start asking questions on "how do you do this" etc - allow mroe organic conversations
- Allows mentor to learn how they frame certain conversations, how the train of thought runs
- Tailored and relational approach
- Effectively modeling, providing paragon examples of behaviour and development
- Linking students to alumni to see different examples of success to aspire towards
- With increasing using of tech, it can be insular and isolating - the reality it is stil you by yourself facing the screen; different from interacting in person and doing things
- Opportunities to grow in certain domains and skillsets may be lessed with tech

## Other approach
- Working with students to self-examine and come to awareness of what's going on with them
- What are you going to do about it now that you are aware?
- operate on the premise that the person who knows you best is you
- Our job is to help you become aware of what's going on with you

# Mid-internship and post-internship check-in
- Check in with student and employer
- All internships we helped get for students don't last more than 3 months, mostly summer vacation

# Univerisyt level
- Brand new residential college for AI - acacia college
- Set up with main college
- University pushing equally hard as Singapore/MOE on tech skills
- Do we really have a choice? Don't push then how?
- Not just a student level, on a staff level they are pushign AI like mad
- If you don't push AI, students and staff will use AI anyway - it's kind of like a shortcut for certain things
- Might as well join and shape the narrative by pushing hard and going in on it
- Know how youth professional development is like and what happens during certain age groups, I see the inmpacts that technology has, I have to help students gain that awareness on not just benefits of technology and how it helps them in personal and prof development, but also be aware of the gaps and inadequacies that happen as a result of their lifestyle using technology on day to day
- They don't realize that technology shapes theor day to day personal interactions, tjat they become more insular and inward looking
- and to think about impact on larger group or community as first instinct anymore - not sure if its related to tech
- E.g. students don't turn on camera when you do video workshop - smth as simple as that; not comfortable with being seen
- these are anecdotal, no data yet
- increased expectation or demand for wfh days
- have students hoping to get jobs that are totally remote
- not something that the prev generation would naturally expect
- there is some sort of shift somewhere, unsure what
