# Key takeaways for book ready set go:
- Wrote in 2020
- Started biz in 2021
- Online safety was not a conversation
- Saw the gap in knowledge 
- Common sense - US based reviews + cybersafety lessons etc
    - They were the leaders
- Market is so boring, technical, full of jargons
- Book was very illustrative, for parents and children
- We had to have sth to show ppl
- Ship quickly as entrepreneurs then get feedback

# More into B2B than B2C for kids safety
- Parents won’t pay for online safety solutions
- Severe lack of awareness
- Parental controls are under utilised
- 7% of parents actually use the parental controls in a useful way
- So cyberlite collabs with schools instead
- If I started charging for my webinar, no one would attend
- After the webinar they will feel they are so behind, but there are ways, 1 week of iPad free tantrums
- B2B with corporate sponsors - corporates have more resources — sponsorship model
    - Eg. Palo Alto networks
- MOE Challenges:
    - Do not work with external groups
    - We can’t endorse private companies
    - Every school has their budget etc 
    - Directly with every school 
    - Talk to HODs etc 
    - IMDA support us — book got cleared by them
    - Our content was generally aligned with IMDA’s guidelines
    - IMDA helped connect us with schools
    - Word of mouth now
    - Good to have govt by your back!

# Why are corporates invested? And how did you do it?
- Right person right time
- Network a lot — we will fly all over the world to network
- Sell ourselves, we tailor our pitch to who we are talking to
- We knew that Palo Alto might care — their corporate brand alignment

# AI literacy / Tech advocacy
- We dont work with tech products eg, META
- Microsoft is a responsible brand and they care about safety
- We are relatively product neutral — we don’t sell for you
- Tech vs Policy
    - Comes down to how much the govt cares
- Pacific Islands — eg. Fiji — reach govt through Facebook 
- AI came at end of 2023 
    - Push came from Microsoft to build them a toolkit
- What is it?
    - Llm 
    - Bias, hallucinate
    - What makes a good prompt
    - AI companionships
- Some parents are not using AI
    - But children already have used 100% AI

# Why not focus on Singapore landscape vs being a global player:
- SG operations are self sustaining
- 3-4 years: solid ground in SG (small mkt)
- 200+ pri and sec sch 
    - Vs Bangalore 1k schools 
- More for Asia pacific
    - We know the culture
- All watching YouTube/snapshot — in South Asian countries
    - Kardashians and Andrew tate

# Age ranges:
- Across the board
- 7- 17 years
- Working group for 2-6 years
    - Lower literacy rate in this group
- Right now primary, secondary
- 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 15-17
- Map out what they are exposed to at that age
- Research and frameworks

# Most critical age:
- Hard to say one age group in particular
- 10-12 AND 13-15
    - Given more independence online
    - But because parents are unaware of the risks, they are stepping into the 13 age
    - They are accidentally veering off eg. Roblox interacting with strangers
- We tell parents and teachers, start young

# Impt factors of user experience in workshops:
- Colours , design
- Content wise - not preach, no yelling no lecture
    - Very interactive
    - Same apps, but adults and children get different experience
    - An adult saying: “Im an expert in cybersecurity I am going to dumb down firewall to you” — condescending tone

# Has parents paying for services now with more awareness? No. 
- Very tough audience to work for
- They still dunno what they dunno
- Sometimes bans etc gets them talking but no one does anything
- Parents think I’m also on TikTok and insta - and I’m not being cyberbullied, so kids are ok too
- Huge disconnect from our parents. We need a new parenting style
    - Eg. Nina told her parents that they need to wear seat belts
    - We have to teach in schools to go home and tell your grandparents that not to fall for scams etc.

# For profit model for cyberlite vs nonprofit
- Looked into converting to non-profit
    - 80-90% of funds need to go back into SG
    - Limiting to go global
- Funding for international organisations 
    - Limiting if not volunteerism
- More reporting and paperwork in nonprofit

# Domain expertise
- Us from the team, feedback, surveys
- Research out there, MOH, WHO - screen time guidelines — public research
- Fierce networkers — policymakers, child protection
- Distil these info for the audience
