# On comparison of childraising cultures 
- Netflix show, Old Enough (Japan culture)
- Mediacorp version of it
- Got introduced to idea that japanese children are very independent
- Wanted to try it out with own kids in Singapore
- Not common in Singapore to send young kids on their own
- SG Parents had mixed feelings about the show

# Background as a Parent
- Was working in Bangalore with husband
- Husband found job in SG, wife came along as dependent pass
- Difficult to find work as dependent pass holder
- First child born as a foreigner; but became singaporean by the time he was 2
- 7 years apart
- Second was born as Singaporean
- Singaporean children have to go to MOE schools, cannot go to private schools in Singapore by law (some exemptions)

# Experience raising first kid (2008)
- Was super prepared, knew she was going to have a child someday, excited
- Spent alot of time reading about child psychology
- Didn't have a job, so had a lot of time to prepare
- Motherhood was a breeze, was fun, wasn't hectic, wasn't stressful
- Not a household manager, didn't need to care about stuff 

## Digital experience in 2008
- Launch of first iPhone (2007)
- When iPhones came into market, changed people's minds on what platforms are about
- Had nokia and blackberries back then
- Bought first iphone in 2009, haven't looked back, has been core apple user 
- switch out phones every 2 years, had contract because excited about new models (had coporate discount)

## Parenthood and iphones
- did not modify experience of parenting
- phone used as phone, laptop was used as laptop
- phone was not essential, and did not contribute to any form of parenting
- did not need to rely on phone as a parent
- Did use social media for communication for family overseas
- Would show baby to parents, not vice versa
- Actively remember closing child's eyes when tv is on
- Did read about harmful effects on eyes for kids for any type of screen
- Songs, books, and alot of talking
- Started reading to him at 2 months old
- Very INTENTIONAl on bonding experience

## Playgroup
- Went to playgroup at 2 years old, for 2H
- Husband wanted to let him see more people and socialize
- For socialization 
- Up till Kindergarten

## Different school starting ages
- SG has latest starting age for primary school: 7
- Japan: 6 (Same for US/UK, Bangalore, India)
- NZ: 5 (Curriculum is more chill)

# Experience with Second Child (2015)
- Had to juggle alot of household management, taking care of first kid as well
- Did not spend as much time with second child as with first
- Had more hands ready for her

## Digital Experience
- First child was 7, screen time allowance for 45min - 1.5H (there was an upgrade at some point)
- Doesn't mean that he never has more than 45min, it just means when family is going for long drives, had to make him sit in car for long, would have screen time
- Had small DVD player in car at 3 years old, Would turn it on when things got difficult
- But did not have to use it for babysitting activities
- Would have been easy for second child to be exposed, but tried not to

## Second child's screen use
- Second child was screen free about 2.5 years
- But couldn't stop her because grandparents who stayed months at a time would use devices infront of her
- Grandparent would be spending hours at a time on phone
- Felt it was harmful for her kid to watch videos over grandparents' children
- Decided it would be better to curate a digital experience for her than have her exposed to screens on other people's devices, uncontrolled
- Smartphones took over adults' lives, affects children too
- Second child went to full day childcare

## Curated digital experience (up till P1)
- Never showed children teletubbies
- Did not use YouTube, used DVDs during first chid's time, and then Netflix for second child
- Mostly TV, some times used iPad
- Already had an iPad
- Second child did not start YouTube until primary 2 
- On TV, in living room where I am
- On iPad, on speaker and you would be around
- Mostly shows
- "Educational" videos, as child remembered
- Emphasized on language, wanted kids have good language as parents were not native speakers
- Knew that once they went to primary school, parents would not have much control over language skills
- Back then shows had a certain quality
- Bob the builder, Thomas the train (First child)
- Pingu, Peppa Pig, a bit of Dora (Second child)
- Chose Netflix over YouTube, cannot go back to change it every 10-15min - YouTube tempts with other short videos

# First child's primary school digital journey

## Computer games
- After P1, exposure to new more exciting world out there
- Peer pressure
- Peer pressure for parents too
- Don't want child to be bullied or look like he doesn't have smth, if everybody else is doing, then maybe we should allow him too
- After P1/2, starting picking up games
- Some are okay like Minecraft (like it, it encourages creativity)
- P4/5, picked up fortnite, but still allowed him to play - because everybody else played fortnite, didn't want him to be bullied
- Fortnite was an MMRPG, wasn't keen; doesn't have proper end; also violence
- Was still curating shows to watch together, and fortnite was one of those things that brought something different in our lives - but did allow 
- Was not always supervised, could not monitor for 2H. But did not have headphone, usually on speakerphone
- Was one of those rare children who could switch off even in the peak of the game (2H)
- First child was pressing for Fortnite, other children would also talk about Fortnite (child's friends), that's how she found out it was popular -- felt indirect peer pressure

## Smartphone games
- Did not enjoy smartphone games
- Was not exactly excited about having phones
- Got first phone at P5/6
- Them having phone does not mean access all day long
- They have a device with acc registered on it\
- Family ecosystem around iPhones - parents have access to children's iPhones and settings
- According to apple, when kids are 16, they are not under iPhone's parental supervision
- But stopped doing parental supervision when he turned secondary school, could not decide when he would come home, call me

## iPhone Parental Supervision

### Second child
- Screen time 8-10pm 2H for school days
- Weekends, will use TV/Netflix - doesn't control how long she uses tv
- Does go down to play with friends, but requires parent to be there
- Parents would change phones eveyr 2 years, would pass it to kids or parents
- Second child leaves phone and ipad at home, does not bring to school
- Has access to drawing application procreate all day long
- Has access to facetime and messages, but contacts are limited
- Parents are the only contact (not as restrictive as kids keitai)
- Nobody else knows her number
- normal sms cannot come, only iphone to iphone
- If she gets message from unknown number, she will alert parents
- Opened 24/7 access to duolingo
- Camera and photos 24/7 access
- Apple music 24/7 access
- Have to subscribe to these apps
- Bought procreate to prevent ad pop-up, ads are usually junk, and free drawing apps usually have ads to more games (not high quality games)

### The need for location services
- Never felt the need to track kids within Singapore
- Until P6, they're not going anywhere, only 5min from home
- Husband finds it essentia to accompany on most days
- Usually accompanied when they go to school
- Pedestrian traffic for morning school going is high, feels safe
- Until P4, they didn't have to come home alone, school only 5min away
- Enrichment classes, always accompanied
- First time i felt need to track child was when first child went to school 1h20min my public transport
- Had parental anxiety, installed a location tracking app (Life360, recommended by sister in Australia)
- Within 2-3 days, realized the app was draining the battery (phones were old phones). So child wasn't keen on sharing locationm, would switch off when he reached school. So turned off the app.
- Agreement: whenever parent called, don't need to answer, just send message
- Child doesn't always notice phone, can be doing something else

# Secondary school
- Doesn't restrict child's app use in secondary school
- Knew password when she handed the phone over, but not sure now
- Trusted child to tell her anything
- 2 years ago jokingly asked him if he would tell her password; child said he never changed password
- Asked if he thought she would look, he said he didn't think she would
- Child keeps computer on when he goes to school
- Parent does not pry

## Parental anxiety
- Trust plays alot of difference
- Brought up example of vaping, can bring up discussions about such with children
- Don't want to keep advising child to the point they would lose interest
- Rather be a friend he would turn to
- Comfortable with child having smartphone because of the trust
- Thinks child is already an adult, not worried about
- He grew up along with iPhones, has seen things gradually progress, has seen dangers happoening slowly like bullying and scams - would think that he would understand

## More Parental Anxiety over Second Child
- Back then when parents did not have dependency on phones
- But when second child was born, adults already had dependency on phones and lifestyles had changed
- Second child has only seen the world where every adult she sees is on her phone
- Worried that she does not know there is another mode of living
- Now she has a phone with restrictions, two years later she will have phone with full access - worried she may not know where to draw that line and stop
- Want second child to still in two years have unrestricted access like her first child, have confidence in biulding the trust 
- Don't know if first child has that awareness but he seems to do

# Covid experience
- Aligned with first child's secondary school, gave full smartphone access, no difference
- But for second child, who was 4 years old, covid period made a huge difference
- there was nothing else to do, dependence on screen became so obvious and inevitable
- couldn't restrict second child to one or two hours a day
- Playgrounds were on lockdown, couldn't meet anyone, only so much entertainment you can do for a kid
- Screentime increased rapidly during that time
- Even though second child has 2H of private device screentime, she also has unlimited access to TV - these were habits that came during covid

## Benefits of screentime to parent?
- Can be a good time of unsupervised time for parent to have time
- May have used screentime as 'babysitting' during extreme moments when she needs something to engage her, usually  not
- Unsupervised play was easier when they were babies, because baby can be put in  baby chair and buckled up
- Don't think have heard people in circle who would resort to screentime for own free time
- But know many would use it for feeding, esp among Indians, because Indian parents think feeding child alot of food that you can care for them
- Had alot of arguments with own parents about it, would not force feed; did not haveto use screen times, would use books

## Access to books
- When they were younger, used physical books
- Bought alot, and supplemented with library books
- Digital book use only started after she bought a Kindle, kept a copy of harry potter, first child would borrow kindle to read them
- First child does not reach for books anymore, even back then when he was a child, he would probably go for digital first if he wasn't restricted
- Second child's default would be TV; especially after covid
- Second hcid reaches for books when she says no to TV, or creating something; would make something far more than she reaches for a book

## Games for Second Child
- Childish RPG? Roblox/Minecraft
- Use Phone for customizations, likes to make things (iPhone customization app)
- Some gender differences there, doesn't like games where you go around shooting people, doesn't like racing activities either
- Trying to get her interested in coding since she is interested in creating and customizations

# Any Emergency situations?
- Has never happened
- Closest thing, was first child asking to top up his debit card (need to be 15 to get debit card, so got a YouTrip card as no restrictions) [Might want to look into payments for kids]

# Do they need to call their friends?

## First child, only for playing
- For first child, not until secondary - boys don't care much about chatting or talking as much as playing together
- Fortnite talking together
- Never heard him chitchat with friends for anything
- Secondary school, project and sch work
- Did happen where she didn't approve on first child's 1-2 friends, felt that attitude was changing a little - stopped spending time with them (saw through physical interaction)
- Felt bad about intervening that way, but 2-3 years later thanked her, said she was right and see their behaviour

## Secondchild chats more
- Second child started using whatsapp to talk to friends (P4)
- At 6 oclock she'll start turning on ipad to play roblox, whatsapp 
- Videocall on whatsapp
- Whatsapp doesn't have parental control features, wish it would have 

## Anxieties over chatting on whatsapp
- Has some anxiety over who she talks to on whatsapp, happened once or twice
- No matter how the kids are, but who they spend time with mater alot
- Also noticed behavioural changes in second child after hanging out with girl, but did not cut ties instanteously. The girl was more of an influencer. Had alot of discussion with her about that
- Mostly behaviouiral changes; would say was a lucky instinct - still not happy about handing whatsapp at this age
- Does not thing whatsapp is child-friendly. 
- She does get random messages from unknown numbers. But fortunately she doesn't get to see them as she only gets access to phone out of school.
- Usually deletes the scams or unwanted msgs for child before she sees them
- Had to give second child access to whatsapp as everybody else in school had whatsapp -- alot of peer pressure 
- If there were a better, safer way to communicate, would definitely go for it
