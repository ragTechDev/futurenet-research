## Kids Age
- 6 and 9
- Same primary school
- Youngest 

## Screens for Learning
- Introduced since young age, mostly for lessons
- don't use phones but have their own ipads
- don't get to use it all the time, only when they have lessons
- lessons that they signed up from china
- spouse is from china, alot of classes from china
- use it to attend lessons, don't let them use it to play, except for son recently
- use it to play once a week
- classes in chinese: math and chinese classes taught in chinese
- recently also signed up for english and math classes run by local organisations or academies
- no difference which country you come from, eperience is slightly similar, doesn't impact decision
- come from a content quality perspectvie and safety
- for classes not worried about safety, because we know who is running the classes and can observe class

# Social media exposure concern
- more worried about other apps and social media stuff
- do not let him use any social media
- but son is still exposed to it through his friends, like 6-7 trends. or any other memes in primary school, spreads in school and in person
- kids with phones showing to other kids
- know his friends sometimes show him videos, friends at the playground - there are older kids, some even p5 (not just in school)
- don't get to control what is shown
- when he was p1/2, somebody showed him a video of a monkey flinging poo, the person said the monkey was like her son (cyberbullying)
- for kids, it is upsetting because they cannot handle such humour, maybe 11 yo thought it was funny not bullying, but because of that younger kids might not be able to handle
- don't let kids access such stuff, but still gt affected by it- kids goes to playgroud 3 times a week for an hour, 7 days half days he goes
- goes alone, parents sometimes still working. ask helper to follow and observe sometimes. but after awhile i let him go and play himself. he has regular group of friends, but sometimes can't control who goes. so small amount of risk
- has been going for abt a year since p2, moved to new place in october last year.
- randomly would get such stuff, get bullied because he is the new kid on the block
- was wonderin gif he should be allowed to go down; tech makes this problem worse
- even if you don't allow usage of the devices, the peple on the playground
- memes and bideps are like viruses, they live on in people's heads
- the ideas spread: best case doesnt make sense, worst case it is harmful
- as a parent it is pretty frustrating - you are doing your best to get your kids protected, but when you go out it is difficult to protect

## School devices
- school is fine, have trust in gov orgs
- gov is updated on internet safety
- recently there;s advisory on recommended screen time for kids. still relatively new for current generation of parents
- when son was young, i got youtube, and letting him watch very stimulating videos
- tnought it was a good thing, cos he could count, but realized later it was not good
- daughter took a longer time to learn stuff, because it's not blasting at her screen 2h a day
- has much better attention span
- instead of letting her watch shows, sent her to art classes when she was younger at 4yo for two years
- when she does stuff, she is veryt patient, teachers commented her focus and concentration is much above average
- made a mistake for the first child
- very hard to reverse, 'damage' is already done
- probably the child i affected, brain is affected for their whole ife, can't really change that
- feels salty, because alot of it was youtube kids for son. after awhile ir ealized the word 'kids' behind youtube doesn't really mean much. its just another platform to extract money. feel pissed about taht fact. 
- you trust these orgs like google, but it turns out that these tech companies they are not trustable
- they claim to create environments safe for kids, but it is only RELATIVELY safer. feel betrayed, platform is quite trash
- all these tech that we grew up in, they weren;t such money hungry entitities compared to today. They have used exploitation of users down to a science, even kids
- human exploitation - like animal testin g-- so messed up

## growing up comparison
- also grew up with tech since i was 4, was using computers before it had a gui. comparing tech i grew up then and now its so different.
- tech in the past was trying to be useful
- games in the past wasnt as exploitative, didnt do so much research
- games kind of sucked, if you died you had to restart the whole thing
- sometimes had to save, still quite frustrating
- but it was good for me as a kid, forces you to have better concentration, to replay stuff, alot of repitition
- but nowadays i need hints in a game what to do, there will be a timer for hints. you don't get stuck, you don't get time to work your brain a little -- quick gratification. dumb down stuff so it is not as frustarting to play
- but frustration is ood for kids, will train their patience
- used to be you had to go online to read game faqs, everything intext
- if you are playing playstation ahd to go on comp and read about it, then go back to playstation to do it
- had to retain information then, but now the games build in all the hints and tutorials
- alot of quick rush of enjoyment
- good for busy adults, but if you are growing up and alot of time, then it's not good

## plays games as an adult
- do not let kid play games or watch
- don't want to expose them to the poison
- been playing games since 4, in the beginning was very simplge games, very simple math games
- more of flash games, prev there was no flash, so games were on CD, path eecutable then you played
- later on played mostly on consoles, had play station 1, 2, tyhen PC gaming in early 2000s, then started playing mroe on PC
- playing PC there's more of online, WoW, Ragnorok online, have online communities
- in online communities, are exposed to not good stuff, people that are nasty to you and online forums
- feel like technology evolved when I am able to deal with it
- stuff like this as a little toddler it owuldn't be that accessible
- wasn't accessible for me as a yougner teen, so wasn't exposed to too much time
- but nowadays if you have a tiktok acc and you are 6, yyou can esily access of war, kid seeing that is so messed up
- for my age, technology evolved as i grew up but now it is not
- never struggled with all these, it was funny in secondary sch had friends who print our porn on paper and pass it aorund in class just to traumatize people
- but right now you don't have to create or print, they have phones, you can share it
- if children are on whatsapp, they could receive stuff on their phone
- parents worst nightmare
- wnatever harm you think could happen now could happen anytime now, and you feel kind of hapless
- everytime you come from work, your kid will be crying and telling you that someone showed me this video and made me sad
- sometimes would be kids demonstrating memes, like kid calling her BRUH - annoyance at best, at worst mentally damaging

## Roblox
- when he plays, parent knos what he is playing, and he watches
- plays roblox, sometimes chats on it
- roblox is the app with the most pedophiles
- don't want to deprive him of the fun, but worried about what he does

## introducing phone to son
- would rather control the fire so i can control the damage, rather than keep it so clean and the moment there's a fire or virus the kid 'dies' cos he is too clean
- think son needs to learn the skill, but want to do it in a controlled manner
- dicussed with spouse, dw to give phone but give a watch, so can call us
- he does not want to give son ability to text, feels it is too overprotective and prefer a phone that can call and text
- want to expose him to same technology that other kids are using
- imagine in our time everybody had phone and you had a pager, it is so embarassing
- believe parental controls can be done
- think she can disable app installation on phone
- if he had whatsapp he can msg people, can read messages once in awhile
- for primary sch kids, dont think they have the right to privacy at the moment because they cant handle dangers by themselves
- prefer to allow them to use stuff but not install apps
- only install stuff that i allow
- if he has friends, i would watch who he adds and who he texts
- because once he gets his phone

## phone
- text and calls that is
- anything mroe will consider in the future
- he does go to classes himself, and takes trains
- travels home from school by himself, sometimes disappears for an hour and it is quite worrying
- started putting air tag in his bag, so can tell where he is
- but still can't call him, if he is late by an hour, i have no idea
- one day he was late by an hour, tracke dhis location, it was not a usual pathway otw home, he looked like he was walking home form sch instead of taking the bus. wondering why he would do that, but couldnt just call him. only found out later when was pretty pissed alr. he said oh yea my friends are walking home today so i decided to go with them. if he had phone he could tet me abt that or ask my permission to do it
- even though singapore is very safe, even as adults we still encounter dangeours adults in public
- pri sch is within 1km, but because of the way roads are made, he has to take a bus. takes 20min for an adult to walk, for kids they walk slower, might be 40min
- aftersch classes a few stations away. he goes to think academy, takes train from eunos to paya lebar and changes trains
- sometimes he forgets his wallet, but very rare

## air tag
- runs on flat lithium battery
- CR2032
- has a bluetooth connection, connects to iphones that are nearby and sends location
by itself it isn't so powerful, it relies on network of iphones in the ecosystem
- battery is cheap have 20 of those, haven't needed to replace it

## frst device likely to be iphone
- parent is also using iphone
- i like the way apple is more user-centered, parental controls are pretty good
- android feels like beta software to me, was fun to use as a student, could do so like jam wifi signals
- not a student anymore, agyer i had first trial, i have no time for apps crashes
- needs stability for phone, then got iphone
- especially when i am carrying son, need hand to answer calls - hence apple watch
- from perspective of parental controls, and apple ecosystem, likes their location tracking, feels slightly easier, less friction to setup, easier to search for solutions when you get stuck
- pretty sure android is not bad but as a parents you dw to deal with less polished devices
- rather have less features as being an early adopter is overrated, if you're a late adopter, everythingis made perfect already, not straggling with imperfections in software
- same approach goes to technology for kids, wants to be a late adopter for stuff

## confidence in parental controls
- not really, but still think i am smarter
- if yo search screentime tracking on ipad, dont think you an delete it easily
- not sure if he can delete it
- went to check i gave him an hour to play on his ipad, but it shows up as 2 hours
- but if he plays a game and deletes the screen time it will probably be a problem , but need to check
- but you can set time limits for certain apps, and what happens when time limit is hit
- on the lower setting it is shown as a reminder and you re allowed o ignore
- also option to stop the app when time limit is reached
- but don't choose the latter option, understand how frustrating it is to play a game and get booted out - will probs give extra 5min, but sometimes 5min becomes an hour. But sometimes trust is breached so it's hard to manage
- requires alot of trust; kids trust her more, they know if they did smth wrong, kids know parents have unconditional love. the way you express yourself when you are angry - kids have to trust to admit to you when they are wrong. especially when they grow up and outsmart you
- important to have a good relationship with your child first, and tech stuff is part of that
- same as if you had a boyfriend, don't want to be constantly checking their phoen adn reading all their messages. it is just evasion ofprivacy but have to do it if there's zero trust
- rather slowly expose son and tach him how to handle incidents as they occur so he can be better at handling the stuff
- eg as an adult if i see video i don't like and it gives me bad emotion s- i will disli,e the video
- but for kids, they probably don't know how to manipulate the algo like that, they probably will just be abused by the app for max engagement

## examples of teaching incidents
- infering from own issues
- couple years ago started unfollowing own friends, not because people were bad people, but i realized i started becoming salty about life they were presenting online (going on trips, very pretty, younger than me etc)
- as adults require mental strength to be on guard and handle this emotion, body dysmorphia
- especially for parents, mental energy near zero at end of day, and all these social media can break you
- all these thigns wil happen to kids too, and not as adults
- at least as adult i know i can indulge and stress eat knowing i will be able to come back form it in a few months or a year
- because i had a stable foundation growing up without social media
- children don't get the resilience the same way we did
- we need to artificially create this (equivalent to a vaccine, creating an environment where harms can happen, but can try to process it)

## not an option to not expose kids to phone
- when they finally get their phone, they are going to get sexting and other werd stuff
- like suddenly you have all of this power, you can do whatever, it is really dangerous
- don't believe in homeschooling and isolating kids from the dangers
- when you're parents you get very protective, but if you think back of the friends you made with overprotective parents, in your head you think 'what is wrong with these people'
- don't want son to be a social outcast on all these experiences
- don't believe in isolation
- parents think of worse case scenario; children can get tired of it

## ai
- any parent woul dprobably be wary about chathpt and open ai
- wouldn't expose kid to random beta product that might destroy their babies
- would only invest in products that are well-tested
- all the ai products probably can only come when they are 16, not now
- dw child to develop schizo at 10 because of ai companions
- but son knows about AI, through his friends, and uses Siri sometimes on his ipad
- kind o fmy fault, because i use it infront of him
- at least siri is trash, can't really do much with it
- son told siri to tell me jokes, and son would repeat it to parent
- it's funny because it's cute, but imagine it is more insidious (eg how babies are made qustion - would have heart attack)
- never know what may happen when you leave tech to your kids
- we were kids once, we had all the time in the world to find hacks and workarounds - they have mro free time than you have and they are smarter than you

## school env
- might ask son about 
- mostly playground people as someof them are older
- parents with kids around my kdis age are more cautious

## Netflix kids
- quality of content on netflix is much higher and doesnt rely on jump cuts 
- on youtube it really bad, way too fast, too much colours and over stimulating (we thought was a good thing in the past, realized less stimulation is better)
- sesame street is good, but not blippi
- youtube kids - no standards
- children's shows that have high budget have professionals that create quality content
- think they have a better idea of what is good content for kids
- user-created stuff is just adults trying random things, trying to get more viewers
- focus is more on viewership rather than brain development (like instant noodles for kids)
- sometimes no choice, have to use device because it is for parents mental health
- let them watch tv anyway -  i need a break
- parents will feel guilty about it but after awhile you get over the guilt, and you let them indulge - vet good quality content
- netflix kids is satifactory, like cartoons we watch on old sch tv
- but do not allow grandparents to use phonea s dsitraction for kids, so expect the few times kids are with her the grandparents should have full attention
- paid for youtube premium, because kids use it for music content for music lessons. kids do violin. but if you do not pay for premium, it exposes themt oads. and ads are quite targted sometimes. ads are sewage - am paying to not have brains be used for that purpose
- also pay for netflix

## notes
- very small subst of parents who knows how tech works, uses tech, grew up in gradual xposure evnronemtn and now with kids
- people tend to be very black and white about such things if they dk how it works esp ai

## Additional Notes from PR Review by Interviewee
- Forgot to mention that "TV Time" for both kids is usually limited to 1 episode on Netflix, around 25mins / day. Occasionally 1 hour.
- TV time can be traded for game time on the Nintendo Switch 2 with age appropriate games like Mario Kart, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Sonic X Shadow Generations.
- In line with ad-avoidance, I also highly prefer paid games. Free games especially those on iPad are often full of ads, micro-transactions and game currency e.g. Roblox's robux. Hence the choice of Switch 2 as a gaming platform vs iPad. I prefer to not expose my developing children's minds to psychological manipulation.
