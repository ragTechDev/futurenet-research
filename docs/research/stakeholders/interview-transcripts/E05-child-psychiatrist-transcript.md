Dr Adrian Interview

Child and adolescent psychiatrist

Was doing general psychiatry.

Was there a switch from general? 
- Within psychiatry, all actually do adult psychiatry
- There are some specialties within it
- Child and aDOLESCENT - he is pracitcing for 10 years
- Fellowship is done from Canada in 2014
- Not possible within SAF context 
    - Many of them their issues stem from childhood but not caught 
    - But dig further comes from younger
    - But the NS under high pressure might start acting out
    - OCD, Autism, other mental disorders

Pychiatry vs psychotherapy
- Psychiatry: Branch of medicine, mental and human behaviours
- Clinical psychologists: thorough research and systematic assessments to help determine severity and clinical conditions
- Most of us work a lot with psychologists called multi disciplinary approach to the ppl we are help

Now that you are in child and adolescent, age definition? 
- operationally looking into their schooling
- Up to Primary school is covered by child psychology
- Up to 21: working definition for adolescent 
- But bit grey 
- But we do treat some as adults according to their identity, family, maturity
- In SG, KKH Child psychiatry — 18 years onwards is adult care
- There’s some fluidity
- Their families are also sometimes heavily involved up to 21 year

Why is there a difference in child vs adult psychiatrist 
- Family 
- Through adolescent — one of the stages of development in life 
- Provision of care, legal requirements

Within child are there intrinsic differences?
- Kindergarten are usually lower limit
- Up to 6 years old — related filed of developmental pediatrics
    - A lot of milestones
- Referred to child guidance clinic after 
- It’s very broad and very different approaches 
- Every few years we have to change the approach, just like parenthood

Schoolin age as factor of differentiation 
- Is because environment change — definitely
- Kindergarten to primary (more formal) then secondary (more pressure on studying)
- Even head teachers are also working closely with child psychiatrists are recommended to follow 
    - Eg. Exam time limits
    - Pressure wise
    - Schools play a very impt role in a child’s life

Usually a parent brings in the child?
- Then school might be involved with parent’s permission (other empt caregivers)
- Outside schools like tutors etc
- Sports etc too 
- He gets in touch with them if they are related to the child patient

Are there cases where school counsellors identifies the child and goes to you?
- They dun go straight to me.
- Private clinic has fee payment component
- Urgent psychiatric care and parents not around then schools bring kids in
- If not parents must definitely be involved.

Your opinion on Anxious Generation book - new generation thrust into digital world (mostly in western world) have anxiety
- Not based in Singapore
- What are some trends?
    - Training in psychiatry started in 2008
    - Anxiety has definitely increased
    - Some ppl say they are more comfortable to talk about it now so there is a rise in that sense too
    - Most colleagues agree anxieryty has increased in the last 10years
    - First go to school in Pri 1 — there’s already anxiety
    - First few days is ok then it might become separation anxiety disorders
    - Then might become habitual anxiety disorder or OCD (intrusive thoughts)
    - Does present a lot in primary school years
    - Secondary — teenage it evolves into anxiety attacks
        - First presents as abdominal pain etc
        - Depressive emotions becomes predominant 
        - Vulnerable to depression
    - Continuation of anxiety happens and over 10 -20 years is definitely a rise.
    - But not saying it’s due to digital devices? — Yeah, not direct connection

Do parents complain about phone usage?
- Yes definitely games, social media, find it hard to takeaway the phone
- They will find ways around it even with parental control
- Throw a fit if we take the phone away
- Is definitely brought up and have to address
- Very common
- Teenagers who stop attending school regularly
    - But might be due to anxiety
    - But they are using phones a lot at home
    - Sleeping later
    - Exacerbating the overall issue
    - Even kindergarteners (I don’t see so many)
        - Because they don’t want medicine
    - But at a young age already have device issues
    - Enforcing the rules by parents is the difficult part
    - Very hard for parents — this is something they do express as a society
    - MOH did release guidelines on screen time 
    - All these are also platforms needed for work, communication within family
        - So it’s blur line
        - After using for work then use for social media
        - The time on apps should be contextualised to individual needs
    - Those on autism spectrum disorder have issues in friendships in schools
        - They need guidance
        - They also benefit from online friendship
        - And they make meaningful friendship
        - So not to say the screen time is always a bad thing
    - Eg. Games — for some kids it’s a way to form their self esteem
        - Be able to achieve something 
        - Must ack that is impt for thier childhood
        - If parent restricts it until 18years for eg, parents are depriving the opportunity/social interaction
    - It should be a societal effort
    - Parents and MOH has hours to each activity but it’s very app/function/child dependent

Do parents ask how much screentiee?
- Most parents do their own research so it’s ok
- But the younger they are the less you should expose them
- It’s not that It’s bad
- But more online time means less time in physical world
- What is the give and take
- Parents should know what is appropriate at every age group 
    - Follow the ratings of videos/shows
    - Eg. Squid games — meant for older teens and above
    - I know primary schoolers have watched it and I dun think it’s healthy for them
    - There are adult things in there
    - Parents should talk to the kids and adhere to age appropriate content
    - Better have a good reason if they are watching above their age group and parents should be with them while they watch it — more nightmares, disturbed sleep, need parents to be around them more

These shows that are expert backed, do they include child psychiatrist like yourself?
- Board of censorship — there are child experts who are there in Singapore

But for social media there isn’t a gate keep?
- For signing up only
Do your patients use social media use it at the correct age?
- No younger primary schoolers are also on IG
- Almost like sms but it’s more than that
- Ppl able to show photos, texts 
- Exclude ppl from groups etc
- Definitely requires societal efforts to 
- Unfriended, no longer followed, cyber bullying is a serious thing in Singapore
- Has to do with instantness of social media
- Tends to be very one-sided
- Very open to optinions
- Ppl think they are protected by a screen so can be meaner


What advise do you give to parents if they confused for devices?
- Supervise for sure
- Be firm 
- But older primary — need to emphasise importance of communication and not punish, enter the child’s world, understand why they are playing, who are they playing with
    - But not every parent can do that, practicality of time
- No secrecy rule since young
- Won’t let them go to bad part of town (in US context) then how do we let them enter the online world just like that
- Not snoop on them all the time also, parents must respect the child also
- Across the age group — there’s a general increase in autonomy
- Using family chat groups to model good social behaviours for the child
    - They take after what we are doing in physical and social world
    - Must walk the talk
- Even dinner table eg.
- Should have a place in the house where everyone honours the no phone policy
- Gen z some of them are very aware of themselves using the phones etc
- Not always adults know best, some times teens will also know what’s best for them

As a psychiatrist - opinion on AI chatbots being psychiatrist?
- Very real, a considerable number or older teens
- They are pretty good actuality — quite sensible
- No need to book appt and there 24/7
- Won’t dismiss them completely 
- For a handful of my patients is a god guide
- But can’t be overreliant on it
- Must remind them that AI can fail and reinforces negative emotions
- General way is it affirms a lot of what you ask it
- Will validate your emotions alot — more reasons to feel strongly about your negativity
- suicides are not common but still 1 life is big too
- No secrecy here too — parents should have access to it (especially if the parents are healthy enough to deal with it)
    - Not abusive parents 
- Become a crutch for you, if you only depend on it, and advise is also dangerous 
- 

Very balanced views — because of the expereience in these areas
Tech is neutral and it’s about how you use it

We are no longer gatekeepers to knowledge— it’s more on help them understand things, provide nuance to what they read, esp in our local context, information overload,
