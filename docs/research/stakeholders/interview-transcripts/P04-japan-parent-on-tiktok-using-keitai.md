## Kids Keitai Video on Tiktok
- kid started keitai in 2023 first grade
- kiods start sch and walk to sch in japan
- switching over to elementary sch, were walking with her in nursery
- decided to get her phone, but didn't want to get her smartpghone, had seen effects 
- even if you put parental guard, kids could make their way around it
- when i was teaching, they had it for a long time, a kids phone
- it had a screen, earlier models had a normal led screen, it's selective on who you can call, no apps no internet
- these days aot came with gps tracker
- she was only six, no need to get her smartphone with all the other stuff, let's get her the kids pohone
- probably other kids will also have kids phone
- turns out other kids felt it was too young for a kids phone
- was one of the first to get kids phone, worked out really well
- thought would like to share about it, knew kids phone was a japanese hting, recorded it right after getting the kids phone
-didn't expect it to take off in tiktok
- alot of parents regretably buy phone for kids, they want GPS and alot of the flip phones don't have gps (idk)
- want to be able to keep track where kids are so no choice but get iphoen and kids phone
- if other coimpanies could see this and see theres a market on it, they could make it

## another type of device
- there's also a speaker device, like a walkie talkie, parent gets a voice messages in their phoen and answer back 
- they can listen and talk
- alot more kids have this

## Knew about negative effects of smartphones
- lots of parents give their kids smartphones
- already see babies use smartphones, see it all the time when they go out on their walks
- felt babies didn't need their phone, found it sad
- was reading a little bit about what social media was doing
- from begining were a relatively screen free family for kids

## Inspiration
- inspired from  mother in law, when raised children in 80's, didn't have tv at home
- if they wanted to watch tv, they waent to friends house to watch tv
- sghe would get stack of books, would save toys by building popsicle sticks, made on boat with popsicle sicks
- husband would spend time redrawing over dinosaur head
- the end result of keeping them screen free, was that husband is now architect in top company (kengo kuma), second brother is a host and has his own show, third is a fashion designer, worked at armani; levis

## japanese culture
- maybe awareness has gotten maybe better
- do see it sometimes these days?
- resposnibility for kids is still put into them in elementary school, have to clean their own classrooms, don't like to do it (same will still fake it)
- have self-responsibility and respnsibility from others here
- culture here is you can't make too muc time, and putting phone infront of kid is great way to do so esp in restaurant setting
- don't see alot of first graders walk around with smartphones, but see sixth graders middle sch kids more that age get a smartphone
- don't know if it really has shifted their personalities yet, have in some places in the west
- remember traveling to philipines and staye din resort, they had entertainment room for the kids, grp of kids who were 12, could only watch youtube shorts on tv - not interested in anything else. when she asked for her turn, noticed entertaiment not age-appropriate with vulgraity and kids were watching that. Kids were really fighting them for it, had to have the screen. Asked to switch it to doraemon
- don't think that bad in japan, kids still know how to play outside, not as bad as parents who let screen babysit parents all the time
- definitely different compared to other western countries
- there are some kids who are really glued to screens here, was on a walk with dog, there was a boy with grandma who was glued on screen - grandma was tryna have convo, kept trying to ask grandma to shut up

## priorities when it came to choosing phone
- gps was a benefit, it had the capability for her to read text msgs from us, also could call anytime instead of waiting for parents to answer on text
- also sends notifications in text messages if she makes call to someone else, tells us where she made the call
- the features on kids phone, including the alarm is more extensive than just the walkie talkie, which is just communication and gps tracker
- still a good buy, she's in 3rd grade now

## thgouhts on ntt docomo not expanding on global market
- in the us, there are alot of school shootings, they do have the iphone, but there alot of parents who wish they could have the phone with all the features but without apps and social media
- elementary kid don't need
- wish they see comments in her video, feels there is a strong market for it
- there used to be Firefly in the states

## kids feedback
- she likes th ephone
- likes that she can take photos and videos
- liek that she can call us, feels good abt it because other kids around her age don't have a smartphone, most have the little walkie talkie
- no peer pressure to have smth that's cooler
- might wants parents smartphone cos of games but thats it
- other parents say to keep smartphone away from kids as well, based on regret that they have done it; 
- we probably will run out of steam, will probably replace it with another phone that looks more mature but isn't really a smartphone - will look into that later, maybe 16
- could look like a smarpthone, but doesn't have access to the apps - no tiktok, no instagram, no facebook, no snapchat; nothing that would alter her view on peer pressure that people she doesn't even know
- might call it a grandma phone, a phone that would be a bigger version of kids phone, maybe could take notes, call us on phone, could text more people than just parents, with friends -- easy and basic, limited internet connectivity, maybe has maps; more independent, tell her where to go

## alarm feature
- no real life situation for her to use alarm
- it was quite stiff, wouldn't pull out, now quite lose can come out on accident
- did have couple incidents in neighbourhood, but not directed to her
- sch reported that a boy saying a man came up and touched backpack
- nearby trains tation, a woman was slit on throat by another man, was a korean national in japan, boyfriend had followed her from korea - was a mth ago or so
- do have some incidents in neighbourhood, but nothing towards her
- tell kid to keep lanyard around neck
- overall is pretty safe

- parent is only one she can sends pictures to (can't send to dad, only one admin allowed)

## Additional Notes
#### In the US context:
- Parents already accept phones due to school safety concerns (e.g. school shootings)
- But wish for an iPhone-like device without apps/social media

#### kid's feedback (if she wanted a better phone) 
- She’s grateful because most kids her daughter’s age don’t have a phone like this or if they had, they’d have the walkie talkie model. 
- It’s a plus being able to call parent and talk instead of just sending the voice over walkie talkie and hoping they got the message.
		
#### Parents’ remote control clarification
- Parents cannot remotely control the phone
- Parents have no access to the phone directly without internet, setup is done on the kids phone and parent only has communication through texts.
		
#### School rules/keeping phone in bag
- Phones are never used during school hours
- Communication goes through teachers / after-school programmes
- This aligns with an existing cultural norm

#### Competitor mention
- Some commenters mentioned Firefly - suggests further research.
