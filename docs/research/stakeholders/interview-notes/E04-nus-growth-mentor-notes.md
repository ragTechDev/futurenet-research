## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- NUS College offers growth mentoring focused on career guidance and life coaching (unique offering since 2023)
- Students are 80% Singaporean, 20% overseas, pursuing interdisciplinary undergraduate studies
- Interdisciplinary approach: T-shaped/Pi-shaped education combining specialization with broad knowledge base
- Special internship program emphasizing interdisciplinary work and intentional learning
- Students increasingly using AI for CV writing, LinkedIn optimization, and job applications
- Growing preference for remote/WFH opportunities and video interviews over in-person meetings
- Students showing discomfort with face-to-face interactions (e.g., not turning on cameras in video workshops)

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- **False Persona Creation**: AI tools enable students to create CVs and applications that don't represent who they truly are
- **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Young adults exhibit over-confidence, believing they already know everything
- **Social Media Anxiety**: Constant comparison causes students to make rash career decisions trying to optimize without knowing what they're optimizing for
- **Lemming Effect**: Students flocking to popular choices (e.g., adding data science majors) without understanding why
- **Loss of Personal Skills**: Over-reliance on tech causing deterioration of interpersonal and workplace readiness skills
- **Insular Behavior**: Technology making students more inward-looking, less community-oriented
- **Face-to-Face Discomfort**: Real insecurity and lack of confidence in meeting people in person
- **Tech Savviness ≠ Readiness**: Being tech-savvy doesn't equate to workplace readiness; fundamental core skills are lacking

### Desired Features / Needs
- **Self-Discovery Workshops**: Help students discover who they are and align CV with authentic self
- **Values Clarification**: Workshops to help students understand what's important to them
- **Awareness Building**: Help students recognize gaps and inadequacies resulting from technology use
- **Relational Approach**: Friend-first, organic mentoring that allows tailored guidance
- **Alumni Connections**: Linking students to alumni as paragon examples of different success paths
- **In-Person Interactions**: Opportunities for face-to-face engagement and community building
- **Skills-Based Assessment**: Moving away from CV/cover letter reliance to actual skills demonstration
- **Mid and Post-Internship Check-ins**: Regular touchpoints with students and employers during 3-month internships

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Employers switching to in-person interviews and skills-based assessments to combat AI use
- Need for authentic representation in applications rather than AI-generated content
- Importance of genuine human connection and relationship building

### Opportunities / Ideas
- **"Touch Grass Week"**: Dean's initiative encouraging students to get off phones
- **Acacia College**: New residential college for AI being set up
- **Interdisciplinary Hub**: Strong potential for NUS College to be a hub for interdisciplinary education
- **Shapeshifters**: Focus on developing adaptable students who can work well across different contexts
- **Renaissance Student Model**: Students who can intermingle various skills without over-relying on tech
- **Self-Examination Approach**: Operating on premise that "the person who knows you best is you" - helping students become aware
