## Gist
The meeting was an interview with the Kids Keitai Japanese team about their child-focused communication device and service. Participants discussed the device's target ages (early elementary school, with transition around grades 4–6), design choices to limit functions (phone, messaging via Plus Message, camera; no open app store), and safety priorities such as easier notice of incoming calls, parental control and filtering, and minimizing classroom disruption. The team described development challenges — implementing GPS tracking, building an Android-based device without Google Mobile Services, customizing messaging (Plus Message), and data migration issues — and explained user research and stakeholder consultation (parents, education boards, local governments). They also reviewed the regulatory and cultural context in Japan (school rules typically restrict device use during class), differences across countries, market pressures from cheap smartphones and trackers, and the uncertainty whether limiting device features reduces overall screen time. The meeting concluded with thanks and an intention to share recordings, research findings, and consider future collaboration.

## Key Discussion Points
- Purpose: They developed a child-focused communication device to enable safe, minimal communication between children and guardians while reducing classroom disruption.

- Target users: Primarily early elementary school children (6-10); many families transition around grades 4–6 as demand for full smartphones grows.

- Core features: Phone, closed-family messaging (customized Plus Message), camera, location tracking services; intentionally no open app store to limit exposure to third parties and unknown contacts.

- Safety priorities: Make incoming calls/messages more noticeable (esp Kids Compact), restrict distracting functions during school time, and design with child-friendly size/appearance.

- Development challenges: Implementing reliable GPS tracking, building an Android device without Google Mobile Services, customizing messaging functionality, and managing development costs.

- User research: Interviews and testing with parent–child pairs (e.g., groups of first–third grade families) and consultations with education boards and local governments informed design choices.

- Regulatory and cultural context: Many Japanese schools ban device use during class; rules vary by municipality and are resistant to major change; policies differ internationally.

- Market factors: Availability of cheap or subsidized smartphones and second-hand devices pressures the product segment; standalone GPS trackers are also competing solutions.

- Parental feedback: High satisfaction from parents for safety-focused, limited-function devices; children often later desire smartphones for broader app/social features.

- Data migration concern: Non-GMS devices face challenges migrating user data to mainstream smartphones, which may lead to churn when families switch devices.

- Uncertain impact on overall screen time: While device restrictions reduce phone use, it is unclear whether children shift usage time to other devices (TV, tablets); no definitive internal data yet.

- Future considerations: Legal requirements for mandatory filtering services, configurable parental controls per age group, and international adaptation strategies.

## Follow-Ups
- Share the meeting recording and any notes with participants and confirm consent for storage/use.

- Investigate and summarize regulatory guidance by municipality and national education authorities regarding children carrying devices in school.

- Follow up on international expansion considerations (cultural differences, market readiness in Korea, Southeast Asia, US).

- Schedule a follow-up meeting (Natasha's Sendai contact to send email of the kids keitai team) to share progress and explore potential collaboration opportunities.

- Research into Android OS and Google Mobile Services

- Look into [Plus Messenger](https://plusmessenger.org/)

- Discuss next steps on collaboration

## Follow up questions
- Are there many false alarms on the alarm?
- Are there success stories on the emergency feature? (Might offend? haha)
- How did you balance battery drainage with GPS location?
- Why Plus Messenger and not just normal SMS?
