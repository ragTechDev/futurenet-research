- Works with regulars signed on to army
- Primary age group focus: 17-24 years of age
- Expertise in IMH (Institute of Mental Health) and public service

# Link to Digital Wellbeing Project
- How young people could be affected by technology
- Cannot cut them off from it - it's an integral part of their life
- Need to understand the pitfalls and dangers rather than complete avoidance

# Social Media & Mental Health Impact

## The Pitfalls
- Social comparison is a major issue
- Social media warps self-esteem
- Content is specially curated - not what an average person's life looks like
- Overly viewing this content makes people feel inadequate

## Self-Esteem Issues in Practice
- Self-esteem is one of the common issues clients present with
- Also see pressure from school, money, expectations of what is needed to be "ok" in life

## What She Suggests to Clients
- The age group (17-24) already has awareness that social media isn't accurate
- But children might not be aware of this
- She reminds them that this content is not accurate
- Encourages looking at stories from less advantaged lifestyles
- Look at real life a little bit
- But acknowledges it can be so addictive

## FOMO & Engagement Pressures
- Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
- Keeping up with trends
- Pressure to be glued to this content

# Screen Time & Healthy Boundaries

## How to Avoid Doomscrolling?
- Explore alternative unwinding activities
- Not cut it off completely - need greater variety of activity
- Can still browse a little bit
- But not your entire free time

## Impact of Giving Children Screens (2 years old+)
- Overstimulation
- Not healthy
- Limits their sensory development
- We used to touch things, explore things

## Can Development Be Recovered Later?
- Children are changing very fast during formative years
- Easily molded during this period
- Can be molded later, but we don't want to waste the formative years

## Attention Span & Boredom
- Lower attention span (research is not solidified yet)
- Their ability to sit with boredom - sometimes us adults even struggle with this
- When they are deprived of entertainment, it will be harder for them to pay attention
- Prolonged duration of less stimulating activities (1-2 hours) is also not good

## Kindle Books vs iPad Videos
- Kindle books are definitely better than videos

## Social Comparison Solutions
- Instead of viewing curated content, go out
- See the real world
- See what an ordinary life looks like
- People are surviving

## Nature Therapy
- Psychologists have now found that being in nature has positive benefits (plants and trees)
- Therapists are promoting these kinds of treatments

## Digital Detox Duration
- 21 days of detox is not necessary
- Might be 1 week

# Peer Pressure & Policy Context
- Peer pressure affects kids and adults
- Definitely affects parents too
- Australia banned social media for children
- Lawrence Wong is also trying to reduce screen time in Singapore

# What's a Healthy Boundary?

## The Balanced Approach
- Little give and take
- Definitely not unlimited access
- Also not completely deprived of it
- Need to expose them to it

## School Rules
- When you are in school - not allowed to bring phone, or not turn it on
- Some schools have this rule

## Home Screen Time
- 1-2 hour screen time
- Instead of letting the phone babysit the child
- Parent and child together use the device

# Parental Control & Privacy

## Social Media Age Restrictions
- Social media usually requires 13 years old minimum

## How Much Privacy Should Parents Give Their Kids?
- Children are exploring their autonomy
- Will pushback against parents
- Ideal situation: Parents will have a lot of interaction with the child since a young age
  - So child grows up with sharing with parents
  - As they grow up and start discerning what is good and bad, then parents can let the child be

# Cyberbullying & Online Safety

## The Problem
- Anonymity enables harmful behavior
- Online games are pretty toxic, competitive, with verbal abuse

## Trusted Circle & Exposure
- Important to consider the child's trusted circle
- How wide is the child exposed to on the internet?

## Platform-Specific Risks
- Roblox has pedophiles on it who befriend children

## Co-Play as a Solution
- Parent is also playing with the child
- Parent gets to see what kind of interactions the child is exposed to

# Solution Opportunities

## Create a Protected Online Space
- Protected and safe for children
- Recognition that not all parents have time to be with the child all the time

## Family Device Addiction Challenge
- Hard to convince the adults to put down the phone
- Family's addiction to phones is a widespread issue
- If parents are informed of the dangers of device addiction, they might change
- Important to point out the benefits of new solutions
