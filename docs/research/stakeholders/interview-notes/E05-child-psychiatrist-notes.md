## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- **Practice Background**: 10 years in child and adolescent psychiatry, fellowship from Canada (2014)
- **Age Definitions**: Operationally based on schooling - primary school for child psychology, up to 21 for adolescent (though KKH transitions at 18)
- **Granular Age Group Treatment**: Psychiatrists treat each age group very differently with distinct approaches every few years (similar to parenthood stages). Broad classifications include: **Kindergarten (up to 6 years)** - lower limit, related to developmental pediatrics with many milestones; **Primary school** - more formal environment, increased structure; **Secondary school** - more pressure on studying, exam stress. Environmental factors driving this segmentation include changing school environments (kindergarten → formal primary → high-pressure secondary), different legal requirements and provision of care at each stage, varying levels of family involvement, and developmental stages that require fundamentally different therapeutic approaches.
- **Multi-disciplinary Approach**: Works closely with clinical psychologists, schools, tutors, sports coaches, and other caregivers
- **School Involvement**: Schools play very important role; head teachers work closely with psychiatrists on accommodations (exam time limits, pressure management)
- **Rising Anxiety Trends**: Definite increase in anxiety over last 10-20 years (since training started in 2008)
  - Primary school: separation anxiety, habitual anxiety disorder, OCD with intrusive thoughts
  - Secondary/teenage: anxiety attacks (presenting as abdominal pain), depressive emotions become predominant
- **Device Usage Patterns**: 
  - Teenagers stopping school attendance but using phones heavily at home, sleeping later
  - Even kindergarteners showing device issues at young age
  - Parents find it very hard to enforce rules and take phones away
  - Children find ways around parental controls and throw fits when devices removed

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- **Parental Control Challenges**: Very common complaint - parents find it hard to take away phones, enforce rules is the difficult part
- **Exacerbating Mental Health**: Phone usage at home exacerbating overall anxiety/depression issues
- **Age-Inappropriate Content**: Primary schoolers watching content meant for older teens (e.g., Squid Games) leading to nightmares, disturbed sleep, need for more parental presence
- **Social Media Misuse**: Younger primary schoolers on Instagram despite age requirements
- **Cyberbullying**: Unfriending, unfollowing, exclusion from groups - serious issue in Singapore
- **Instantness Problem**: Social media tends to be very one-sided, very open to opinions, people protected by screen can be meaner
- **Blurred Lines**: Devices needed for work, communication within family, so hard to draw boundaries
- **Societal Effort Needed**: Individual parental efforts insufficient without broader societal support

### Desired Features / Needs
- **Parental Supervision**: Parents must supervise device usage
- **Firmness with Communication**: Be firm but emphasize communication over punishment (especially older primary)
- **No Secrecy Rule**: Establish from young age that there are no secrets about online activity
- **Age-Appropriate Content**: Parents should follow ratings of videos/shows, have good reasons if allowing above age-group content
- **Parental Involvement**: Parents should watch age-inappropriate content with children if allowing it
- **Enter Child's World**: Understand why they're playing, who they're playing with (though not all parents have time)
- **Respect and Autonomy**: Balance supervision with respecting the child; general increase in autonomy across age groups
- **Model Good Behavior**: Use family chat groups to model good social behaviors; walk the talk
- **Phone-Free Zones**: Have places in house where everyone honors no-phone policy (e.g., dinner table)
- **Contextual Screen Time**: Time on apps should be contextualized to individual needs, not blanket rules

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- **Not Always Restriction**: Screen time not always bad - some benefits exist
- **Autism Spectrum Considerations**: Kids with autism benefit from online friendships, make meaningful connections with guidance
- **Self-Esteem Building**: Games can help some kids achieve something and form self-esteem
- **Social Interaction**: Restricting until 18 deprives opportunity for social interaction during childhood
- **AI Chatbot Concerns**: 
  - Can't be overreliant on AI mental health chatbots
  - AI can fail and reinforce negative emotions
  - Validates emotions a lot, giving more reasons to feel strongly about negativity
  - Can become a crutch with dangerous advice
  - Parents should have access (if parents are healthy/not abusive)
  - Suicide risk consideration (even 1 life is too many)

### Opportunities / Ideas
- **Granular Age-Based Digital Access**: Given that psychiatrists treat each age group very differently with distinct approaches every few years, there is space for digital solutions that provide granular age-appropriate access controls aligned with developmental stages (kindergarten → primary → secondary) and changing environmental factors
- **MOH Guidelines**: MOH released guidelines on screen time
- **Balanced Approach**: Tech is neutral - it's about how you use it
- **Positive Use Cases**: 
  - Online friendships for kids with autism spectrum disorder
  - Games for self-esteem building
  - Necessary for work and family communication
- **Teen Self-Awareness**: Gen Z some are very aware of themselves using phones; not always adults know best
- **AI as Tool**: AI chatbots can be good guide for handful of patients - quite sensible, available 24/7, no need to book appointment
- **Information Access**: No longer gatekeepers to knowledge - role is to help understand things, provide nuance in local context, manage information overload
