# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stakeholder Research & Interview Guide

Welcome to the stakeholder research area of the FutureNet project.  
This folder explains **how to plan, conduct, and document stakeholder interviews** and outlines expectations before, during, and after each session.

The goal of stakeholder interviews is to understand the needs of children aged 5–12, parents, teachers, schools, and experts regarding **safe, distraction-minimal, ethically designed communication devices for kids**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Stakeholder Interviews

We conduct interviews to:
- Understand real needs and behaviours around children’s device usage
- Learn what parents, teachers, and students value most
- Verify or challenge our design and product assumptions
- Identify risks, constraints, and opportunities
- Inform UI/UX decisions, feature roadmap, and positioning strategy

Interviews are not sales pitches — they are learning conversations.

---

## 🧠 Stakeholder Types

We aim to speak with:
- Children (5–8, 9–12)
- Parents and caregivers
- Teachers & school staff
- Safety and education experts
- Technology and policy advisors

We use stakeholder codes (e.g. P01, T01, S03) to protect identities.
