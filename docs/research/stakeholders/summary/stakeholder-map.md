# Stakeholder Map

| Category | Stakeholder | Influence | Interest | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Primary Users | Children 5–8 | Low | High | Indirectly represented via parent interviews (P02, P03, P06, P07, P08). Needs: age-appropriate content, low overstimulation, co-use routines; vulnerable to early screen overstimulation and limited sensory exploration (E03). |
| Primary Users | Children 9–12 | Low | High | Indirectly represented via parent interviews (P01, P04, P06, P07). Needs: safe comms for school/social inclusion, protection from bypassable browser/search loopholes, peer exposure realities; early autonomy stage where "graduated access" becomes critical. |
| Decision Makers | Parents | High | High | Core decision-makers for device/app adoption and rules. Strong needs cluster: safer comms than WhatsApp (P01), bounded screen time + co-use (P02), bypass-resistant controls + dashboards (P04), safety-first comms/GPS and multi-admin (P05), school context + AI/cyberbullying concerns (P06), peer exposure + ad/UGC distrust (P07), trust-based self-regulation supports (P08). |
| Enablers | Teachers / Schools | High | Medium | Strong leverage via school policies and classroom norms (E01 notes: school bans/restrictions; in-school disruption concerns). Local teacher notes not captured yet (T01 file empty), so constraints/needs should be validated. |
| Experts | Child psychologists | Medium | High | Evidence from interviewed experts: youth psychotherapist (E03) highlights social comparison/FOMO/self-esteem harms, early-child overstimulation/sensory development, online anonymity/toxicity, and co-use/co-play; cybersafety educator (E02) highlights parent awareness gap and school-based education model; kids device product expert (E01) informs feasibility/constraints of limited-function devices (GPS tradeoffs, migration friction). |
| Regulators | MOE / PDPA / Safety bodies | High | Medium | Influence via school rules, child online safety guidance, and data/privacy requirements. Specific regulator interview notes not captured yet (R01 file empty); assumptions should be validated with MOE/PDPA/IMDA stakeholders. |
