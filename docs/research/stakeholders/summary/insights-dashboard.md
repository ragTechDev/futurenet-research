# Research Insight Log

| Code | Stakeholder Type | Strong Needs | Biggest Pain Point | Key Quote | Opportunity Tag |
|------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|
| P01 | Parent | Safer school chat + better guidance + low-battery location | WhatsApp has weak child-safety; tracking drains battery / can be disabled | "If there were a better, safer way to communicate, would definitely go for it." | #communication #trust #gps |
| P02 | Parent | Guilt-free bounded screen time + age-appropriate content + co-use | Hard to find quality content; stretched bandwidth as working mum | "Parents need to have their own life as well." | #screenbalance #parentselfcare |
| P03 | Parent | Research-backed guidance + low-stimulation media + community | School environment + peer exposure risk; hard to sustain low-stimulation defaults | (No verbatim quote captured) | #addiction #schoolenvironment |
| P04 | Parent | Bypass-resistant controls + parent dashboard + age-based filtering | Child bypasses restrictions and lies; parent must constantly monitor | "I want them not to lie to me." | #parental_controls #dashboard |
| P05 | Parent | Closed/app-free comms + GPS alerts + multi-admin + teen-safe upgrade | Smartphone controls can be bypassed; device admin/remote limitations | "Even if you put parental guard, kids could make their way around it." | #device_design #gps #graduated_exposure |
| P06 | Parent | School-safe modes + AI literacy + staged controls | School tech exposure; worries about AI misuse, cyberbullying, bypasses | "There's really no need to have phones when I know exactly where they are throughout the day." | #schoolenvironment #ai_literacy |
| P07 | Parent | Graduated exposure + ad/UGC avoidance + incident playbooks | Peer exposure undermines home controls; enforcement is emotionally hard | "ads are sewage" | #content_quality #peer_exposure |
| P08 | Parent | Self-regulation support + transition prompts + co-creation | Kids content can still be overstimulating/bypass kids profiles; uncertain future device path | "The earlier they learn the skill of regulation, the better." | #self_regulation #co_use |
| E01 | Expert | Limited-function kid device + school-safe design + migration path | GPS/battery tradeoffs; device transition friction in grades 4–6 | (See E01 gist) | #schoolapproval #device_design |
| E02 | Expert | Non-jargony parent education + school-to-home model + AI literacy | Parent awareness gap; low parental control utilization; parents won't pay | "7% of parents actually use the parental controls in a useful way" | #parent_education #ai_literacy |
| E03 | Expert | Balanced boundaries + offline alternatives + co-use guidance | Social comparison/FOMO harms self-esteem; early screens risk overstimulation; online toxicity enabled by anonymity | "Social comparison is a major issue" | #self_esteem #screenbalance #co_use #online_safety |
