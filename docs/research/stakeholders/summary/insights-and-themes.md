## Themes Identified
| Theme | Insight | Example Quote |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Safety without “full smartphone” exposure | Parents want independence features (location + contactability) but fear app stores, social media, strangers, and bypassable “parental controls.” | “Kids phone is not entertainment.” (P05) |
| Parental controls are high-friction and bypassable | App-level controls fail when the browser/search becomes the loophole; parents want safety that holds even when they are not watching. | “I don’t know how she ends up figuring out DuckDuckGo and discover all these streamers.” (P04) |
| UGC/ads/algorithms are a core trust-breaker | Parents distrust platforms marketed “for kids” and see ads/algorithms as psychological manipulation; they prefer paid/ad-free, curated options. | “ads are sewage” (P07) |
| Screen time is relational, not just technical | Enforcement creates conflict, guilt, and dishonesty; parents need routines that reduce policing and support trust-building. | “I want them not to lie to me.” (P04) |
| Graduated autonomy is the desired model | Many parents want a staged progression (supervision -> guided autonomy -> independence) rather than “ban vs. free-for-all.” | “would rather control the fire so i can control the damage” (P07) |
| Peer/school context undermines home controls | Even strong home rules are weakened by peer exposure and school tech policies; solutions must account for real-world social transmission. | “as a parent it is pretty frustrating - you are doing your best to get your kids protected, but when you go out it is difficult to protect” (P07) |
| Communication needs are real, but WhatsApp is a weak default | Families need school/social coordination; existing messaging lacks child-safety affordances and admin models (contacts, multi-caregiver, school hours). | “If there were a better, safer way to communicate, would definitely go for it.” (P01) |
| Education + plain-language guidance is missing | Parents are aware-but-stuck: low usage of controls, jargon fatigue, and “incident-driven” attention; they need simple, non-condescending guidance. | “7% of parents actually use the parental controls in a useful way” (E02) |
| AI literacy is emerging as a safety domain | Parents/schools worry about kids using AI for homework, bias/hallucination, and critical thinking; they want responsible-use education. | “Some parents are not using AI - But children already have used 100% AI” (E02) |
| Social comparison + FOMO are mental-health risks (not just “screen time”) | Curated feeds drive inadequacy and pressure to stay constantly engaged; younger kids may not understand that feeds are not “real life,” and screen time may not be the no.1 contributor to self-esteem issues. | “Social comparison is a major issue” (E03) |
| Coping skills matter: teach kids to disengage from harmful content | Beyond awareness that content is curated, kids need a simple rule to stop consuming content that makes them feel bad and switch activities. | (E03) |
| Consumption mode matters (active vs passive) | Reading (even picture books) takes more cognitive effort than passive video watching; media choice impacts overstimulation and attention. | (E03) |
| Early-child screens can displace sensory development and tolerance for boredom | Overstimulation and reduced real-world exploration are concerns in formative years; building comfort with boredom and offline play matters. | (E03) |
| Online toxicity is amplified by anonymity; co-play helps parents see exposure | Competitive games and anonymous spaces normalize verbal abuse; parents need visibility into who kids interact with. | (E03) |
| Co-use/co-play is a key safety strategy | Parents want to engage with kids in online activities, but need tools to facilitate this and reduce solo screen time. | (E03) |
| Nature/offline alternatives are essential for balance | Parents want to encourage outdoor play, but need ideas and support for making this a sustainable part of family life. | (E03) |
| Balanced approach to boundaries is crucial | Parents need to balance protection with autonomy, and want guidance on how to achieve this balance. | (E03) |
| Rising anxiety trends in children (clinical evidence) | Definite increase in anxiety over last 10-20 years; progresses from separation anxiety/OCD in primary school to anxiety attacks and depression in secondary; not directly attributed to devices but correlated with increased usage. | "Most colleagues agree anxiety has increased in the last 10 years" (E05) |
| Parental device enforcement is a widespread societal challenge | Clinical validation that enforcing device rules is extremely difficult for parents; children find ways around parental controls and throw fits when devices removed; requires societal-level support beyond individual parental efforts. | "Very hard for parents — this is something they do express as a society" (E05) |
| Device usage exacerbates existing mental health issues | Phones at home worsen anxiety/depression through sleep disruption (staying up late), isolation, and reduced physical world engagement; not necessarily causal but exacerbating factor. | "They are using phones a lot at home. Sleeping later. Exacerbating the overall issue" (E05) |
| Age-inappropriate content exposure causes real harm | Primary schoolers watching content meant for older teens (e.g., Squid Games) leads to nightmares, disturbed sleep, increased need for parental presence; parents should follow age ratings and watch with children if allowing above-age content. | "Primary schoolers have watched it and I don't think it's healthy for them... more nightmares, disturbed sleep, need parents to be around them more" (E05) |
| Cyberbullying is serious in Singapore | Unfriending, unfollowing, exclusion from groups; instantness of social media makes it very one-sided; anonymity/screen protection makes people meaner than face-to-face interactions. | "Unfriended, no longer followed, cyber bullying is a serious thing in Singapore" (E05) |
| Screen time should be contextual, not blanket rules | Time on apps should be individualized to child's needs; benefits exist for autism spectrum (meaningful online friendships), self-esteem building through games; blanket restrictions can deprive social interaction opportunities. | "The time on apps should be contextualised to individual needs" (E05) |
| AI mental health chatbots are double-edged tools | Can be helpful (24/7 availability, sensible advice, no appointment needed) but risks include over-validation of negative emotions, reinforcing negativity, becoming a dangerous crutch; parents should have access if healthy/non-abusive. | "They are pretty good actually — quite sensible... Must remind them that AI can fail and reinforces negative emotions" (E05) |
| Modeling behavior is critical for digital citizenship | Parents must "walk the talk" in family chat groups and physical spaces; children take after what parents do in both physical and digital worlds; phone-free zones (e.g., dinner table) should be honored by everyone. | "Must walk the talk" (E05) |
| Teen self-awareness about tech use is emerging | Gen Z showing awareness of their own phone usage patterns; not always adults who know best, sometimes teens understand what's best for themselves; balance needed between guidance and respecting teen autonomy. | "Not always adults know best, some times teens will also know what's best for them" (E05) |
