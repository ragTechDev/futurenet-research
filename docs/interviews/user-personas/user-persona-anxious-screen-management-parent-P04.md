## Background
This persona represents a stay-at-home parent managing a 9-year-old child’s digital life primarily through home devices (iPad, Nintendo Switch). The parent wants to keep the child safe and age-appropriate online, but is repeatedly surprised by how quickly the child learns to bypass restrictions.

The parent experiences frequent stress and vigilance around screen time: enforcement requires constant attention, and the child’s behavior (lying about usage, seeking loopholes) erodes trust.

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Keep the child safe from inappropriate content (mature streamers, unsafe browsing, random content).
- Maintain reasonable daily screen limits while avoiding constant conflict.
- Preserve trust and honesty in the parent-child relationship.
- Find healthier alternatives to screens that still keep the child engaged and occupied.

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Child rapidly bypasses controls (e.g., shifting from YouTube Kids to browsing YouTube via the browser; using search engines like DuckDuckGo).
- Difficulty finding truly “safe by default” experiences across apps and browsers.
- High monitoring burden: parent feels they must constantly supervise to enforce a 30-minute limit.
- Child shows signs of compulsive usage (struggles to self-stop until device is taken away).
- Lack of compelling offline activities; parent struggles to identify hobbies that compete with screens.
- Trust breakdown moments: child lies about whether they already had screen time.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Bounded screen time that reduces monitoring load | Parent needs short, reliable periods of safe usage without hovering or constant checking. |
| Strong browser-level parental mode (not just app-level) | The browser becomes the loophole; safety must extend across the device, not only within “kids apps.” |
| Age-based filtering and content classification | Prevent exposure to mature gaming/streamer content for a 9-year-old, including recommendations and search results. |
| Parent dashboard with clear summaries | Needs visibility by app/category (YouTube, browser, games) to spot patterns and reduce anxiety. |
| Support for trust-building routines | Helps shift from “policing” to consistent rituals (agreements, review moments, honesty incentives). |
| Offline activity scaffolding | Suggestions and nudges to help children discover non-screen interests (arts, physical play, projects). |

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Daily iPad/TV time (~30 minutes) is actively enforced; gaming allowed (~1 hour/day). |
| Favorite activities | Child gravitates to iPad video content and gaming; limited self-initiated offline play. |
| Communication behavior | Parent expects teachers/caregivers to contact them in emergencies; child does not need direct device communication. |
| Attention span | Child gets “stuck” in screen mode; transitions away from screens are a consistent pain point. |

## Emotional Considerations
This parent feels anxious and tired from constant vigilance, but also deeply protective. They want to be fair and avoid over-restriction, yet repeated loopholes create a sense that “nothing works.”

They feel reassured by:
- Tools that are hard to bypass
- Clear, simple dashboards
- Systems that reduce daily decision fatigue

---

## Quotes (if interview based)
> “It’s very hard to get her off the screen every time.”

> “I don’t know how she ends up figuring out DuckDuckGo and discover all these streamers.”

> “I want them not to lie to me.”
