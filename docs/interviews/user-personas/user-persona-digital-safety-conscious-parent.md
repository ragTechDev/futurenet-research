## Background
Parent of two children aged **10** and **17** in Singapore. Actively involved in managing their schooling and digital lives via MOE tools like **Parents Gateway** and Apple’s ecosystem. Has progressively introduced devices and apps as children grew older, balancing peer pressure, learning, and safety.

Very intentional about digital exposure from early years: initially preferred **TV/Netflix** over YouTube to avoid algorithmic rabbit holes, then gradually allowed more device use as kids aged and social/school needs increased (e.g., WhatsApp for class groups, gaming with friends).

This parent is comfortable with technology and apps, but is cautious about **ads, algorithms, tracking, and unknown contacts**. They experiment with tools like **Life360** but are critical when they don’t work well (battery drain, easy to circumvent).

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Ensure children are **safe online** while still participating in normal peer and school life.
- Maintain **control and visibility** over apps, contacts, and purchases without becoming overly authoritarian.
- Provide **high-quality, ad-free and creative** digital experiences (e.g., Procreate, Minecraft) instead of random or low-value content.
- Gradually move from tight controls to **trust-based autonomy**, especially as children move from primary to secondary school.
- Use school-/government-aligned tools (Parents Gateway, school-approved channels) as reliable sources of information and communication.

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- **Poor search/discoverability** in Parents Gateway for topics like screen time and digital wellbeing.
- Grandparents’ device habits expose the younger child to extra, less-controlled screen time and content.
- Strong distrust of **YouTube ads and algorithms**; finds it hard to control what comes next.
- Existing **location tracking apps** (e.g., Life360) are battery-hungry and can be switched off by the child, reducing reliability.
- **WhatsApp** is necessary for school socialisation but lacks child-safety features; random unknown messages can appear.
- Constant **peer pressure** around games (Minecraft, Fortnite, etc.) makes it hard to say “no” even when the parent is unsure.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Searchable, authoritative guidance on digital parenting | Wants quick, trusted answers (e.g., on screen time) integrated into tools they already use like Parents Gateway. |
| Child-friendly, school-approved communication channel | Needs a safer alternative to WhatsApp for school chat that still lets kids socialise, but with admin/parent controls. |
| Low-power, trustworthy location sharing | Wants peace of mind without battery drain or kids easily disabling tracking; clear consent and visibility are crucial. |
| Strong, granular parental controls | Needs ability to manage apps, contacts, and purchases at different ages (10 vs 17), without constant manual policing. |
| Curated, ad-free, creative content bundles | Prefers to pay for high-quality apps that support creativity/learning over random ad-driven platforms. |
| Support for phased trust-building | Tools should help move from supervision to guided autonomy as children get older. |

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Increased during COVID; younger child now spends more time on TV/devices than older child did at same age. |
| Favorite activities | Netflix/TV, creative apps like Procreate, games like Minecraft/Fortnite/Roblox driven partly by peer networks. |
| Communication behavior | Uses WhatsApp for school and socialising, despite concerns; Parents Gateway for official MOE comms and consent forms. |
| Attention span | Older child more self-managing; younger child more at risk of being pulled into short-form, high-stimulus content (e.g., YouTube). |

---

## Emotional Considerations
Feels **concerned and protective**, especially about the younger child’s exposure to uncontrolled content and unknown contacts. Also feels **intentional and principled**: spends effort curating content, setting rules, and using the Apple Family ecosystem.

Can feel **frustrated** when tools don’t live up to safety/UX promises (e.g., tracking apps that drain battery or can be circumvented; poor search in Parents Gateway). Wants products that align with her/his careful approach instead of forcing tradeoffs between safety and convenience.

## Quotes (if interview based)
> "Chose Netflix over YouTube, cannot go back to change it every 10–15 min – YouTube tempts with other short videos."

> "If there were a better, safer way to communicate, would definitely go for it."

## Acceptance Criteria for Success
FutureNet is successful for this persona if:
- [ ] It offers a **school-approved, safer communication channel** that can replace or complement WhatsApp for kids’ school/social chats.

- [ ] It provides **low-friction, low-battery location features** that are transparent and not easily circumvented.
- [ ] It supports **granular parental controls and age tiers** (e.g., lower vs upper primary vs secondary) without overwhelming complexity.
- [ ] It curates **ad-free, creative, and educational content** so this parent doesn’t have to constantly fight against algorithms.
