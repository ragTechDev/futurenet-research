     <---------------------------------------------------->
           Control preference (High control  →  High autonomy)

     Note: (E01) Overwhelmed Working Parent is “constraint-driven / low bandwidth”
     and tends to sit below this map (needs defaults + quick wins more than ideology).

  - Avoid infinite feeds and short-form rabbit holes.

- **Age transition / upgrade paths**
  - Support staged device/feature adoption (kids → pre-teen → teen).
  - Make “graduated exposure” a default pattern.

- **Low-friction setup + non-judgmental UX**
  - Busy parents need quick wins, checklists, and routines.
  - Avoid alarmist or condescending framing.
