## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- Started Cyberlite business in 2021 after writing book in 2020
- Operates in B2B model (schools and corporate sponsors) rather than B2C
- Works with 200+ primary and secondary schools in Singapore
- Expanding to Asia Pacific region (e.g., Bangalore with 1k schools)
- Targets age ranges 7-17 years, with working group for 2-6 years
- Segments content by age groups: 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 15-17, considering including 2-6 due to increase prevalance of kids being exposted at this age
- Networks extensively globally to build partnerships
- Collaborates with government agencies (IMDA) and corporate sponsors (Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft)

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- **Parent awareness gap**: Severe lack of awareness about online safety
- **Parental control underutilization**: Only 7% of parents use parental controls effectively
- **Parents won't pay**: If charging for webinars, no one would attend
- **Market perception**: Online safety market is boring, technical, full of jargon
- **MOE challenges**: Ministry doesn't work with external groups, can't endorse private companies
- **Parent disconnect**: Parents think "I'm on TikTok/Instagram and not cyberbullied, so kids are ok too"
- **Awareness doesn't translate to action**: Even after bans/incidents, parents don't take action
- **Generational gap**: Need for new parenting style for digital age

### Desired Features / Needs
- **Illustrative content**: Book was very illustrative for both parents and children
- **Interactive approach**: Not preach, no yelling, no lecture - very interactive
- **Age-appropriate content**: Same apps but different experiences for adults vs children
- **Avoid condescension**: Don't talk down to audience (e.g., "I'm going to dumb down firewall to you")
- **Product neutrality**: Relatively product-neutral, don't sell for specific companies
- **Quick shipping**: Ship quickly as entrepreneurs then get feedback
- **Visual design**: Colors and design matter in user experience

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- **Government backing**: "Good to have govt by your back!" - IMDA support and content clearance
- **Corporate brand alignment**: Work with responsible brands (Microsoft) not just any tech company
- **Content alignment**: Content generally aligned with IMDA's guidelines
- **Responsible partnerships**: Don't work with tech products like META, focus on responsible brands
- **Research-backed**: Use research from MOH, WHO (screen time guidelines), public research
- **Network with experts**: Connect with policymakers and child protection experts

### Opportunities / Ideas
- **B2B sponsorship model**: Corporates have more resources than parents
- **School-based education**: Teach children in schools to educate parents/grandparents at home
- **AI literacy**: Building AI toolkits covering LLMs, bias, hallucinations, prompts, AI companionships
- **Regional expansion**: Asia Pacific focus leveraging cultural understanding
- **For-profit model**: Staying for-profit to avoid 80-90% funds restriction to Singapore and enable global expansion
- **Word of mouth**: Leveraging school networks and IMDA connections
- **Tailored pitching**: Customize pitch based on audience (e.g., Palo Alto's corporate brand alignment)
