## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- Chose a Japan “kids keitai” (child phone) instead of a smartphone when child started elementary school (first grade) so the child could walk to school more independently.
- Maintains a relatively screen-free home environment; child gets limited entertainment time (e.g., ~20 min on Switch) and occasionally uses parent’s phone while waiting at restaurants.
- Uses safety/location features extensively: GPS tracking, geofences via Wi‑Fi gateways along common routes/places (after-school area, school route, nursery, friends’ places), and movement-speed alerts.
- Uses the device primarily as a communication tool (calls, SMS, voice message recording, photos/videos) rather than entertainment (no apps/internet).
- Shares product experience publicly (TikTok video) to help other parents outside Japan discover an alternative to giving kids smartphones.

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Strong concern that even with parental controls, children can “make their way around it” on smartphones.
- Limited parental administration model: only one admin allowed (cannot have both parents as full admins).
- No remote control/access to the child’s phone; practical issues like the child turning volume down can block contact.
- Geofence setup takes effort and has constraints (e.g., limit of 10 Wi‑Fi gateways).
- Walkie-talkie style alternatives (Bot Talk is more commonly used in Japan than Kids' Keitai) have communication delay; feels less reliable for real-time needs.

### Desired Features / Needs
- A “smartphone-like” device that looks mature but still blocks apps/social media (no TikTok/Instagram/Facebook/Snapchat) as the child grows older.
- Basic independence features without full smartphone exposure:
  - More flexible texting (beyond only parents)
  - Basic maps/navigation
  - Minimal/limited internet connectivity (if any)
- Multi-admin support so both parents/guardians can fully manage the child device.
- Clear, reliable contactability (e.g., volume/silent-mode safeguards) without requiring invasive remote monitoring.

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Closed network / restricted contacts: selective calling, no app store, no open internet.
- Location visibility and proactive alerts:
  - Entry/exit detection via Wi‑Fi gateways
  - Alerts if the child is moving “faster than usual” (possible vehicle/abduction scenario)
- Emergency readiness: device alarm exists, but parent also teaches “run away if can’t reach alarm” and “keep lanyard around neck.”
- School compliance: phone stays in bag during school; communication routed through teachers/after-school programs during school hours.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Clear international demand signal: commenters/parents (esp. US context) want iPhone-like hardware with safety features but without apps/social media. (She recommends that we look at the comments on her Tiktok videos)
- Product direction: “graduation path” devices (kids phone → teen-safe phone) to delay smartphone adoption while matching social expectations.
- Consider cross-market positioning:
  - US: school safety concerns drive phone adoption, but parents still want app-free options.
  - Japan: norms and school rules reduce in-school device use; kids still play outside more than some other countries.

## Follow-Ups
- Validate market insight with additional non-Japan parents: would they adopt an “app-free smartphone-like” device, and what minimum features are required?
- Explore admin model requirements (multi-admin, caregiver roles) and acceptable degrees of remote management without feeling invasive.
- Investigate exitsing competitors like Bot Talk and historical comparables mentioned by commenters (e.g., Firefly phone) and reasons for decline/failure
