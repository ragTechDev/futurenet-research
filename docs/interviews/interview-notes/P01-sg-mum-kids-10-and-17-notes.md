## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- Software engineer parent, tech-savvy
- Uses Parents Gateway (MOE) for consent forms and advisories; multiple children can be registered.
- Intentionally curates children’s digital exposure: preferred TV/Netflix over YouTube; limited early YouTube access.
- Uses Apple Family ecosystem (parental supervision, app subscriptions, contact limits).
- Allowed gaming (Minecraft, Fortnite) due to peer pressure; phone given in late primary years.
- Location tracking tried (Life360) but removed due to battery drain and child switching it off.
- WhatsApp used by younger child for school socialising; parent uneasy about lack of parental controls.
- COVID increased screen time and normalized more TV/device use for younger child.
- Reads to child daily, finds reading helpful for kids

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Parents Gateway search is poor for relevant topics (e.g., screen time).
- Grandparents’ device use exposes younger child to screens and uncontrolled content.
- YouTube’s ad/algorithmic flow seen as harmful; preference for ad-free paid apps (Procreate).
- Location apps drain battery / can be circumvented; uncertainty about effective tracking.
- WhatsApp lacks child-safety features; random unknown messages appear.
- Peer pressure influences device/game adoption decisions.

### Desired Features / Needs
- Better searchable, authoritative guidance in Parents Gateway on topics like screen time.
- Child-friendly, school-approved communication tool with parental controls.
- Low-power, reliable location-sharing option with clear consent/visibility.
- Granular parental controls for apps, contacts, and purchases; ad-free kid apps that are educational or inspires creativity (Procreate for drawing, Minecraft and Roblox for creativity).
- Resources to support gradual trust-building and transition to autonomy.

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Controls should support a trust-based progression (supervision → guided autonomy).
- Restrict unknown contacts/messages; prefer iPhone-to-iPhone or parent-approved contacts.
- Minimize exposure to ads and algorithmic content; curated/educational content preferred.
- Transparent, low-battery tracking and permission management.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Integrate consent forms, advisories and curated parental guidance into Parents Gateway.
- Offer a school-approved messaging channel with admin controls and safe-contact lists.
- Provide curated content bundles (ad-free, age-appropriate) and app recommendations.
- Implement low-impact location features and battery-aware tracking options.
- Educate grandparents and extended family on device use guidelines to reduce exposure.
- Distinct needs between lower primary, upper primary and secondary student needs; a kids smartphone like [NTT Docomo's Kids Keitai](docs\research\stakeholders\interview-notes\E01-ntt-docomo-notes.md) would likely only cater to lower primary. There are gaps on socialization needs for upper primary onwards.
- Basic, safe entertainment features might be useful so kids do not demand for alternative entertainment in the form of other screens
