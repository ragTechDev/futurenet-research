# Pre-Launch Marketing & Content Plan
## Building Parent Community for FutureNet Phone Kickstarter

**Campaign Period**: January - April 2026  
**Kickstarter Launch**: April 2026  
**Primary Goal**: Build 800-1,000 email subscribers and engaged parent community  
**Channels**: Beehiiv newsletter/blog, RagTech podcast, social media (Instagram, TikTok)

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a 3-month content marketing strategy to build a parent community ahead of the April 2026 Kickstarter launch. The strategy leverages:

1. **Beehiiv newsletter/blog** as the primary content hub
2. **RagTech podcast** integration for authentic storytelling
3. **Social media** (Instagram, TikTok) for community engagement

---

## Channel Strategy

### 1. Beehiiv Newsletter/Blog (Primary Hub)

**Why Beehiiv?**
- Built-in newsletter + blog functionality
- SEO-friendly for organic discovery
- Email list building (critical for Kickstarter)
- Analytics and subscriber management
- Referral program capabilities

**Publishing Cadence**:
- **Newsletter**: Weekly (every Thursday)
- **Blog posts**: 2-3 per week
- **Lead magnets**: Monthly downloadable guides

**Newsletter Structure**:
- **Subject line**: Problem-focused, curiosity-driven
- **Opening**: Personal story or parent quote
- **Main content**: Educational + actionable
- **CTA**: Subscribe, share, or take quiz
- **P.S.**: Behind-the-scenes update or teaser

### 2. RagTech Podcast Integration

**About RagTech**: Tech podcast covering real-life tech topics like AI, career growth, system design, work-life balance, and the human side of technology. Recent episodes include "Can you burn out from using too much AI?", "Why your next promotion might be your biggest mistake", "Engineer retires with Bitcoin to become stay-home dad", and "Momgineer".

**Approach**: Integrate FutureNet naturally into RagTech's existing content style rather than creating separate channel

**Why integrate vs. separate?**
- ✅ Leverage existing audience and trust
- ✅ Authentic storytelling (real life in tech)
- ✅ No need to build new audience from scratch
- ✅ Natural fit: tech founders building for families
- ✅ FutureNet IS a real-life tech story (founders building for their community)

**Organic Integration Strategy** (Not forced, flows naturally):

**Phase 1 (January-February): Subtle Introduction**
- Weave FutureNet into existing episode topics naturally
- Example topics:
  - "Building a hardware startup while working full-time" (career/entrepreneurship angle)
  - "When engineers become parents: How tech perspective changes" (life transition angle)
  - "Why we're building tech for parents (and what we're learning)" (founder journey angle)
- **No dedicated segments** - FutureNet comes up organically in conversation
- Mention in passing: "We're working on this project called FutureNet..."

**Phase 2 (March): Building Momentum**
- More explicit episodes as product takes shape:
  - "The parent tech gap: Why engineers see problems differently"
  - "Building in public: Our Kickstarter journey begins"
  - "Balancing day jobs and startup dreams" (similar to existing career content)
- Still fits RagTech's "real life in tech" theme
- FutureNet becomes a recurring story thread, not the only focus

**Phase 3 (April): Launch Integration**
- Launch week episode: "We launched on Kickstarter: Here's what happened"
- Follow-up: "What we learned from 300+ parent conversations"
- Keep it authentic to RagTech style - honest, relatable, not salesy

**Cross-promotion**:
- Newsletter → Podcast: "Listen to this week's episode where we talk about..."
- Podcast → Newsletter: "Read the full guide in our newsletter"
- Social clips from podcast episodes (existing workflow)
- TikTok/Instagram: Short clips that fit existing content style

### 3. Social Media Strategy

**Current RagTech Social**: Short-form videos from podcast episodes on TikTok and Instagram, plus promotion of tech card game

**Recommendation**: Use existing RagTech channels, integrate FutureNet content organically alongside existing content

**Why not separate FutureNet channels?**
- ❌ Starting from zero followers is slow
- ❌ Splits attention and resources
- ❌ Harder to maintain consistency with 3 cofounders part-time
- ✅ RagTech already has engaged tech community audience
- ✅ Many followers are parents or will be parents
- ✅ Easier to manage one set of channels
- ✅ FutureNet fits naturally into "real life in tech" content

**Content Mix Strategy**:

**Maintain existing content** (60%):
- Podcast clips (AI, career, system design, work-life balance)
- Tech card game promotion
- Tech community content

**Add FutureNet content** (40%, gradually increasing to launch):
- Founder journey clips
- Parent tech problem/solution shorts
- Behind-the-scenes building content

**Organic Integration Approach**:

#### Instagram
**Existing workflow**: Podcast clips, tech card game, community content

**Add FutureNet naturally**:
- **Stories** (3-4x/week): Behind-the-scenes building FutureNet, polls ("What age did you give your kid a phone?"), Q&A
- **Reels** (1-2x/week): Mix with existing podcast clips
  - "Engineer mom builds solution to own problem" (founder story angle)
  - "When your tech skills meet parenting challenges" (relatable angle)
  - "Building a startup while working full-time: Week 3 update" (entrepreneurship angle)
- **Feed posts** (1-2x/week): Carousels that fit RagTech style
  - "5 things we learned building hardware" (tech learning angle)
  - "Parent interviews: Tech perspectives on digital parenting" (community angle)
- **Highlights**: Add "FutureNet Journey" alongside existing highlights

**Content Style**: Keep RagTech's authentic, relatable, non-salesy tone

#### TikTok
**Existing workflow**: Short-form podcast clips, tech content

**Add FutureNet organically** (1-2x/week):
- **"Day in the life" format** (fits existing style like "day in the life of an engineering dad"):
  - "Building a hardware startup between meetings"
  - "When your side project becomes a real product"
- **"Real talk" format** (fits existing honest conversation style):
  - "Things nobody tells you about building hardware"
  - "Why engineers make different parenting decisions"
- **Problem/solution shorts** (educational but relatable):
  - "Parent: 'How do I set up parental controls?' Engineer: 'Let me show you the problem...'"
  - "What parents actually want vs. what tech companies build"
- **Behind-the-scenes** (authentic, not polished):
  - "Testing prototypes in real life"
  - "Parent feedback sessions"

**Hashtag Strategy** (Mix existing + new):
- Keep existing: #TechLife #RagTech #SingaporeTech #WomenInTech
- Add naturally: #BuildingInPublic #StartupJourney #ParentingInTech
- Avoid forced: Don't overuse #DigitalParenting or #ParentingTips until closer to launch

**Content Calendar Balance**:
- **Week 1-4 (Jan)**: 80% existing RagTech, 20% FutureNet (subtle intro)
- **Week 5-8 (Feb)**: 70% existing RagTech, 30% FutureNet (building momentum)
- **Week 9-12 (Mar)**: 50% existing RagTech, 50% FutureNet (pre-launch)
- **Week 13-16 (Apr)**: 40% existing RagTech, 60% FutureNet (launch month)

**Key Principle**: FutureNet content should feel like a natural evolution of RagTech's "real life in tech" narrative, not a sudden pivot to parenting content
