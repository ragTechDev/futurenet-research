## Slide 1 — Cover

**FutureNet Phone**

The smartphone that grows with your child — expert-backed boundaries that update automatically as they mature

Pre-seed deck — January 2026

## Slide 2 — Problem: Parents Are Exhausted and Alone

**The first smartphone decision is overwhelming for parents:**

> "I want my 13-year-old to have a phone for safety and coordination, but I don't want to hand them the entire internet. And I have no idea what's actually appropriate at each age."  
> — Parent seeking first phone for teenager, Reddit

**Three painful realities**:

### 1. Parents are guessing what's age-appropriate
- "Should my 13-year-old have Instagram? YouTube? WhatsApp?"
- "How much screen time is too much at 14 vs. 16?"
- No expert guidance — parents are figuring it out alone
- Constant family conflict: "Why can't I have TikTok? My friend has it!"

### 2. Parental controls require constant manual updates
- Screen Time / Family Link settings must be reviewed and updated every year as kids mature
- Parents spend hours researching, configuring, and negotiating
- What worked at 13 doesn't work at 15 — but who decides what changes?

### 3. Existing solutions fail the "good enough" test

**Mainstream phones** (Samsung, iPhone + Screen Time):
- ❌ High parent effort: Manual updates every year
- ❌ Easily bypassed: VPNs, factory resets, alternate accounts
- ❌ No expert guidance: Parents guess what's developmentally appropriate
- ❌ All-or-nothing: Either full smartphone or constant restrictions

**"Safe phones"** (Bark, Gabb, WisePhone):
- ❌ Static policies: Same rules at 13 and 16 (no graduated access)
- ❌ Too restrictive: Teens reject "baby phones" that isolate them from peers
- ❌ Expensive subscriptions: $15-30/month ongoing costs
- ❌ Not available in Singapore

**Watches/trackers** (myFirst, Karri):
- ❌ Don't meet teen expectations for a "real phone"
- ❌ No path to smartphone independence

### 4. Parents are already familiar with managed devices (PLDs)

**Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) in Singapore schools**:
- Every secondary school student has a school-issued laptop or tablet
- Managed by schools for in-school learning and teaching
- Parents understand the concept of managed devices for specific purposes

**But PLDs don't solve the personal communication device problem**:
- ❌ **PLDs are for learning, not communication**: Laptops/tablets for schoolwork, not for staying in touch with family
- ❌ **PLDs are school-managed for school hours**: Focus on in-school use, not holistic child development
- ❌ **PLDs are not smartphones**: Can't replace the need for a personal phone for coordination and safety

**The gap**: Parents still need to buy their child a **personal smartphone** for communication, coordination, and safety — and they're on their own figuring out what's appropriate.

**Result**: Parents either:
1. ✋ **Give in** → Hand over full smartphone (too much too soon, distraction risk)
2. 😰 **Stress out** → Spend hours managing parental controls every year (exhausting guesswork)
3. ⏸️ **Hold out** → No device (safety concerns, logistics friction, teen resentment)

---

## Slide 3 — Parent personas (from research + Reddit discussions)

We interviewed 20+ Singapore parents and analyzed parent discussions on Reddit. Three recurring personas:

**The Overwhelmed First-Timer** (45%)
- "My 13-year-old is getting their first phone. I have no idea what's appropriate."
- Currently using: Nokia 105 dumb phone or hand-me-down with heavy restrictions
- **Pain points**:
  - No expert guidance on age-appropriate boundaries
  - Paralyzed by choices: "Should they have Instagram? YouTube? How much screen time?"
  - Afraid of giving too much too soon
  - Don't want to repeat mistakes they see other parents making
- **What they want**: "Just tell me what's appropriate for a 13-year-old, backed by experts"
- **PLD context**: "My child has a school laptop for learning. Now I need a personal phone for communication — but I don't know how to manage it."

**The Exhausted Manager** (35%)
- "I'm tired of being the full-time parental control admin."
- Currently using: Mainstream phone with Screen Time / Family Link
- **Pain points**:
  - Spending hours every year updating parental controls as child matures
  - Constant negotiations: "Why can't I have this app? My friend has it!"
  - Controls are easily bypassed (VPNs, factory resets, workarounds)
  - No guidance on when to loosen restrictions
- **What they want**: "Set it once, and have it update automatically as my child grows"
- **PLD context**: "The school manages the laptop for learning. I wish someone could manage the phone for overall development — not just school hours."

**The Holistic Parent** (20%)
- "I want a phone that supports my child's development across their whole day, not just school hours."
- Currently using: Mainstream phone with manual controls, trying to balance different contexts
- **Pain points**:
  - PLDs focus on school hours and learning, but phones are used all day
  - Need to consider homework time, family time, sleep, social development
  - Want expert guidance on healthy digital habits beyond just "screen time limits"
  - Looking for developmental appropriateness, not just restrictions
- **What they want**: "A phone managed holistically by experts who understand child development, not just school compliance"

## Slide 4 — Solution: Expert-Backed Boundaries That Grow With Your Teen

**FutureNet Phone**: The first smartphone with **automatic age-appropriate boundaries** — backed by child development experts, not parent guesswork.

**Core value proposition**:

**"Set it once. We'll update it as your child grows — backed by experts."**

### How it works: Graduated Access System

**Age 13** (First phone):
- Calls/SMS with parent-approved contacts
- No browser, no social media
- Basic utilities (calculator, calendar, clock)
- Location sharing (parent opt-in)
- **Why**: Establish communication and safety without distraction

**Age 14** (Building trust):
- Add messaging apps (WhatsApp, parent-approved contacts)
- Educational apps (Khan Academy, Duolingo)
- Music streaming (Spotify with explicit content filter)
- **Why**: Support school coordination and productive use

**Age 15** (Expanding horizons):
- Add YouTube (restricted mode enforced)
- Maps and navigation
- Photo sharing (within approved contacts)
- **Why**: Enable independence while maintaining guardrails

**Age 16** (Preparing for independence):
- Add broader app access (parent-approved app store)
- Graduated browser access (safe search enforced, time limits)
- Social media (Instagram, with time limits and monitoring)
- **Why**: Practice responsible use before full independence

**Age 17** (Near-adult):
- Near-full smartphone experience
- Reduced restrictions, increased autonomy
- Preparing for transition to adult device
- **Why**: Final year of scaffolded independence

### Why this works

**Every age template is**:
- ✅ **Reviewed by child development experts** (psychologists, digital wellness researchers)
- ✅ **Validated by youth mental health professionals** (IASH, child psychiatrists)
- ✅ **Updated automatically** at the start of each school year (no parent effort)
- ✅ **Customizable** (parents can adjust if needed, but defaults are expert-backed)

**Result**: Parents get **expert guidance** instead of guesswork, and **automatic updates** instead of annual stress.

---

### Core features

**1. Graduated Access System** (the hero feature)
- Age-appropriate boundaries that update automatically
- Expert-reviewed templates for ages 13–17
- Parents don't need to guess what's developmentally appropriate
- Reduces parent stress and family conflict
- **No installation required**: Phone comes pre-configured out of the box — parents don't need to install apps, configure settings, or troubleshoot technical issues
- **Differentiator**: Only phone with automatic age progression, ready to use immediately

**2. Holistic Management (Beyond School Hours)**
- **Different from PLDs**: PLDs are school-managed for in-school learning; FutureNet is parent-managed for holistic child development
- **All-day context**: Considers how a child uses their phone across the entire day — school hours, homework time, family time, sleep, social development
- **Expert-backed for development**: Managed by child & adolescent psychiatrists and cybersafety experts who look beyond just learning/teaching to overall child development
- **Parent-owned & controlled**: Parents own the device and customize based on their family values
- **Differentiator**: Holistic child development focus, not just school compliance

**3. Focus Mode** (optional, parent-configured)
- Parents can set "focus hours" (e.g., during school, homework time, bedtime)
- Locks device to calls/SMS only during focus hours
- Parent-configured, not school-mandated
- **Differentiator**: Parent choice, not institutional requirement

**4. SIM-Unlocked, No Lock-In**
- Not tied to telco contracts
- Parents choose carrier and plan
- Device ownership stays with family
- Works with any SG carrier (Singtel, StarHub, M1, Gomo, etc.)
- **Differentiator**: True ownership, no vendor lock-in

---

## Slide 5 — Why now?

**Convergence of four trends creates perfect timing**:

### 1. Parents are already familiar with managed devices through PLDs (2020-present)

**Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) program**:
- Every secondary school student has a school-issued laptop or tablet
- Managed by schools for in-school learning and teaching
- Parents understand the concept of managed devices for specific purposes
- Managed using Device Management Applications (DMAs) like Jamf, Lightspeed Systems

**What parents learned from PLDs**:
- Managed devices can work when they have a clear, focused purpose (learning)
- Parents are comfortable with the concept of expert-managed boundaries
- But PLDs are for **learning**, not **communication** — and they're laptops/tablets, not smartphones

**The gap parents now recognize**:
- "My child has a managed laptop for school. But I still need to buy them a **personal smartphone** for communication, coordination, and safety."
- "The school manages the laptop for learning. Who helps me manage the phone for **holistic child development**?"
- **Opportunity**: Parents are ready for a **personal communication device** with expert-backed management — different from PLDs, but building on familiar concepts

### 2. Parent exhaustion with manual parental controls (2023–2024)

**Reddit discussions show consistent pain points**:
- Parents spending hours every year updating Screen Time / Family Link settings
- No expert guidance: "I have no idea what's appropriate for a 13-year-old"
- Constant family conflict: "Why can't I have TikTok? My friend has it!"
- Guesswork and stress: "What worked at 13 doesn't work at 15 — but who decides?"

**What parents are asking for**:
- "Easy parental control setup" — set it and forget it
- "Bypass-resistant controls" — can't be easily circumvented
- "Graduated access" — unlock features as teen matures
- "Expert guidance" — stop guessing what's age-appropriate

**Gap**: No mainstream solution offers this. Parents are exhausted and alone.

### 3. Proven international demand (US, UK, Japan, Korea)

**DTC "safe phone" models work**:
- WisePhone (US): $500K+ Kickstarter, subscription model validated
- Sage (UK): Managed iPhone model, strong parent adoption
- Bark Phone (US): AI monitoring + Samsung hardware, popular in parenting communities
- Kiwi Plus (Korea): Telco-integrated kids phone, 100K+ users

**Critical gaps in existing solutions**:
- ❌ **No automated graduated access**: All have static policies or require manual parent updates
- ❌ **Not available in Singapore**: WisePhone, Sage, Bark are US/UK only
- ❌ **Expensive subscriptions**: $15-30/month ongoing costs
- ❌ **Too restrictive or too open**: No middle ground that grows with teens

**Opportunity**: FutureNet is the **first phone with automated age-appropriate boundaries** — and the **first available in Singapore**.

### 4. Age 13 is the critical decision point

**Parent behavior patterns**:
- Ages 7-10: Basic phone or smartwatch (Nokia 105, GPS tracker)
- Ages 11-12: Feature phone or very restricted smartphone
- **Age 13**: First "real" smartphone (minimum age for social media, secondary school transition)

**Market timing**:
- ~70,000 Sec 1-2 students in Singapore (ages 13-14)
- Parents making first smartphone decision at this age
- High willingness to pay for "getting it right" the first time
- **Opportunity**: Capture parents at the critical decision moment

### Why this matters: Replacing parent guesswork with expert guidance

**1. Expert-reviewed age templates**
- **Cyberlite** (current partner): Child cybersafety experts review age-appropriate boundaries
- **Dr. Adrian Loh** (child & adolescent psychiatrist): Validates developmental appropriateness of access progression
- **IASH** (youth mental health): Ensures templates support healthy digital development

**What this solves**: Parents no longer guess "Is Instagram appropriate for my 14-year-old?" — experts have already made evidence-based recommendations.

**2. Parent advisory board (real-world validation)**
- 20+ Singapore parents provide ongoing feedback on age templates
- Validate that expert recommendations work in real family contexts
- Help refine templates based on actual teen behavior and parent needs

**What this solves**: Templates aren't just theoretical — they're validated by parents who've used them with their own teens.

**3. Continuous improvement**
- Partners review templates annually based on:
  - Latest child development research
  - Emerging digital risks (new apps, platforms, bypass tactics)
  - Anonymized usage data from FutureNet devices
  - Parent feedback from advisory board

**What this solves**: Templates stay current as technology and teen behavior evolves.

### Value proposition

**For parents**: "You're not guessing what's age-appropriate — child development experts have already figured it out, and other parents have validated it works."

**For investors**: "We're building an expert network moat that competitors can't easily replicate. Parents trust experts more than they trust their own guesswork."

**Key insights**:

1. **No competitor offers automated graduated access**: All require manual parent updates or have static policies (same rules at 13 and 16)
2. **No competitor offers expert-backed templates**: Parents are left to guess what's age-appropriate
3. **International solutions aren't available in Singapore**: WisePhone, Sage, Bark, Gabb are US/UK only
4. **FutureNet is the only solution that solves parent exhaustion**: Set it once, expert-backed boundaries update automatically as teens grow

---

## Slide 7 — Technical approach

We leverage **proven enterprise device management** (not custom hardware/OS):

**Android Enterprise Device Owner mode**:
- System-level control (stronger than parental control apps)
- Prevents bypass via VPN, hidden apps, safe mode, factory reset
- Zero-touch enrollment (devices ship pre-configured)

**Samsung Knox Configure** (MDM):
- Used by LG U+ Kids Phone (Korea) with 100K+ users
- Cost-effective (S$15/year per device)
- Enables custom launcher, app allowlist, School Mode automation

**Why this works**:
- No need to build custom hardware or OS (capital-efficient)
- Proven at scale (enterprise + consumer use cases)
- Strong enforcement (institutional-grade security)

---

## Slide 8 — Market size

**Singapore secondary school students**: ~180,000 (Sec 1–5)

**Beachhead**: Sec 1–2 students (ages 13–14) = ~70,000 students

**Serviceable market** (conservative):
- 20% of Sec 1–2 families adopt (early adopter + pragmatist segments) = **14,000 devices**
- Average device price: S$270
- Average subscription: S$10/month × 36 months = S$360
- **Total addressable**: S$3.8M (devices) + S$5M (subscriptions) = **S$8.8M**

**Expansion**:
- Upper primary transition segment (10–12 years old): +50,000 students
- Additional geographies with similar school restrictions (Malaysia, Hong Kong)
- Additional product tiers (graduated access, approved app catalog, safe messaging)

---

## Slide 9 — Business model (DTC-first strategy)

We combine **VC funding + Kickstarter revenue** to reduce dilution and validate demand early.

### Funding sources

**1. Pre-seed VC: S$200K** (this raise)
- Funds product development, Kickstarter campaign, founder salaries

**2. Kickstarter: S$100K–S$150K** (Month 3)
- Funds device inventory for initial cohort
- Validates consumer willingness to pay
- Builds parent community and word-of-mouth

**Total capital**: S$300K–S$350K

### Revenue model

**Upfront device sale** (covers hardware + initial provisioning)
- **Retail price**: **S$270** (competitive with mid-range smartphones)
- **Kickstarter early bird**: **S$249** (limited quantity, campaign only)

**Why S$270 works**:
- **Competitive positioning**: Lower than mainstream smartphones (Samsung A35 ~S$350, iPhone SE ~S$450)
- **Easy parent decision**: Similar price to budget phones, but solves the "what's appropriate?" problem
- **Value proposition**: Mainstream phone (S$350+) + hours of annual parental control updates vs. FutureNet (S$270) + automatic expert-backed updates
- **No-brainer for overwhelmed parents**: "I'd pay S$270 to not have to figure this out myself"

**Recurring subscription** (covers MDM licensing, support, policy updates, warranty)
- **S$10/month** (or S$100/year prepaid)
- Lower than competitors (Bark $15/mo, WisePhone $25/mo, Sage £29/mo)

**Why subscription works**:
- **Ongoing value**: Expert-reviewed templates updated annually as research evolves
- **Support included**: Parent support, device troubleshooting, warranty coverage
- **Lower than alternatives**: Half the cost of international competitors
- **Predictable revenue**: Recurring revenue builds defensible business

**Device is SIM-unlocked** (no telco lock-in; parents choose carrier)

---

## Slide 10 — Unit economics (detailed)

### Cost structure (per device)

**Hardware COGS**
- Base device (refurbished Samsung A-series): **~S$80** (pilot) → **~S$150** (commercial)
- Accessories (case, screen protector, packaging): **~S$20**
- **Total hardware (pilot)**: **~S$100**

**MDM + software (annual per device)**
- Samsung Knox Configure license: **~S$15/year** (~USD $10–12)
- Backend hosting + SMS (SOS): **~S$8/year**
- **Total software**: **~S$23/year** (~S$2/month)

**One-time provisioning**
- Zero-touch enrollment setup + QA: **~S$10/device**

**Ongoing ops (annual per device)**
- Support (estimated 0.3 tickets/device/week → ~15 tickets/year): **~S$30/year**
- Warranty replacements (estimated 5% failure rate): **~S$10/year**
- Logistics (shipping, returns): **~S$5/year**

### Unit economics at scale (1,000 devices)

**Device margin** (Tier 1 retail: S$270 device bundle)
- Revenue: S$270
- Cost: S$150 (hardware) + S$10 (provisioning) = S$160
- **Gross margin: S$110 (41%)**

**Subscription margin** (S$10/month = S$120/year)
- Revenue: S$120/year
- Cost: S$23 (MDM/software) + S$30 (support) + S$10 (warranty) + S$5 (logistics) = S$68/year
- **Gross margin: S$52/year (43%)**

**Blended 3-year LTV** (device + 3 years subscription)
- Total revenue: S$270 + (S$120 × 3) = **S$630**
- Total cost: S$160 + (S$68 × 3) = **S$364**
- **Gross profit: S$266 (42% margin)**

### Path to profitability

- **Kickstarter phase** (150–250 devices): Use refurbished devices (S$80 COGS) to minimize capital lock-up
- **Post-Kickstarter growth** (250–500 devices): Continue DTC sales, refine based on feedback
- **Scale phase** (500+ devices): Transition to new devices (S$150 COGS) for quality consistency
- **Target**: Break-even at ~500 devices; profitable at 1,000+ devices

---

## Slide 11 — Go-to-market (DTC-first strategy)

We pursue a **direct-to-consumer approach** focused on parent communities and word-of-mouth.

### Phase 1: Kickstarter Launch (Months 1–4)

**Objective**: Validate consumer demand, fund inventory, build parent community

**Positioning**: "The first phone that grows with your teen — expert-backed boundaries that update automatically"
- **Hero message**: Stop guessing what's age-appropriate — experts have figured it out
- **Core benefit**: Set it once, we'll update it as your child grows
- **Trust signal**: Reviewed by child development experts, validated by parents
- **Parent-owned**: No school dependencies, no institutional failures

**Target**:
- 150–250 backers
- S$100K–S$150K in pre-orders
- **Kickstarter pricing**:
  - **Super Early Bird** (50 units): S$249 (device only) — 8% discount
  - **Early Bird** (100 units): S$329 (device + 6-month subscription) — best value
  - **Standard** (100 units): S$389 (device + 1-year subscription) — S$270 device + S$119 value

**Why Kickstarter works**:
- Proven playbook: WisePhone raised $500K+, Bark Phone successful DTC launch
- Fast validation: 3–4 months to revenue vs. 9–12 months for traditional channels
- Builds parent community: Early adopters become advocates and provide feedback
- Funds inventory: Reduces VC dilution, extends runway
- Word-of-mouth engine: Parents share with other parents in their networks

**Marketing channels**:
- **Pre-launch email list**: 500–1,000 subscribers (parenting forums, Facebook groups)
- **Parent influencers**: Partner with Singapore parenting bloggers/YouTubers
- **Reddit/forums**: r/SingaporeParents, HardwareZone parenting forums
- **Facebook groups**: Singapore parenting groups (100K+ members)
- **Content marketing**: "What's age-appropriate for teens?" guides, expert interviews

---

### Phase 2: Post-Kickstarter Growth (Months 4–9)

**Objective**: Scale DTC sales, refine product based on feedback, build parent advisory board

**Positioning**: "Trusted by 200+ Singapore parents — expert-backed phone that grows with your teen"
- Leverage Kickstarter success as social proof
- Feature parent testimonials and case studies
- Highlight expert partnerships (Cyberlite, Dr. Adrian Loh, IASH)
- Emphasize "parent-owned, parent-controlled" vs. school-managed systems

**Go-to-market channels**:

## Slide 12 — Why DTC-first works

**Advantages of DTC-first approach**:

1. **Faster revenue validation**
   - Kickstarter: 3–4 months to first revenue
   - School partnerships: 9–12 months to first revenue (slow, bureaucratic)
   - **Result**: Validate demand quickly, extend runway

2. **Reduced VC dilution**
   - DTC: S$200K VC + S$125K Kickstarter = S$325K total capital
   - School-first: S$350K+ VC (higher dilution, longer time to revenue)
   - **Result**: More capital-efficient path to traction

3. **Parents understand managed devices (thanks to PLDs)**
   - PLDs have familiarized parents with the concept of managed devices
   - Parents see the value of expert-managed boundaries for specific purposes
   - FutureNet extends this concept to **personal communication devices** with **holistic child development** focus
   - Word-of-mouth from other parents > institutional endorsement
   - **Result**: Building on familiar concepts, not introducing foreign ideas

4. **Faster product iteration**
   - Direct parent feedback loop (no school bureaucracy)
   - Can iterate on age templates based on real usage across full day (not just school hours)
   - Parent advisory board provides ongoing validation
   - **Result**: Better product-market fit for holistic child development, faster

5. **Stronger investor narrative**
   - "We have 250 paying customers with 50+ testimonials" = clear demand signal
   - "Different from PLDs: personal communication device with holistic development focus" = clear differentiation
   - "Expert-backed + parent-validated" = credibility from child development experts, not just school compliance
   - **Result**: Clean traction story for seed round

## Slide 13 — Competition

**Alternatives today**:

- **Mainstream smartphones + Screen Time / Family Link**
  - High parent effort: Parents must manually update settings every year
  - No expert guidance: Parents guess what's age-appropriate
  - Bypassable: Kids find workarounds
  
- **"Healthy smartphone" products (US/UK)**
  - WisePhone, Sage: Static policies (same rules at 13 and 16)
  - No graduated access: All-or-nothing approach
  - Not SG-available; no expert-reviewed age templates
  
- **Trackers / watches**
  - Don't solve teen needs for a real phone (calls, logistics)
  - No path to smartphone independence

**Our differentiator**:
- **Core**: Only phone with **automatic age-appropriate boundary updates** (expert-reviewed, educator-approved)
- **Supporting**: Expert network moat, affordable pricing (S$270), Singapore-first
- **Result**: Parents set it once; we handle the rest as kids grow

---

## Slide 14 — Defensibility (moat)

**Near-term moat**:
- **Expert network moat**: Relationships with child development experts and educators (hard to replicate)
- **Content moat**: Age-appropriate templates (13–17) reviewed by experts, approved by educators
- **Operational moat**: Provisioning + policy hardening + support playbooks
- **Community moat**: Kickstarter backers become advocates and school pilot participants

**Long-term moat**:
- **Product moat**: "Graduated access" system across ages (13–17) with expert-backed defaults
- **Data moat**: Anonymized usage patterns inform age template improvements (what works at each age)
- **Institutional moat**: School/educator partnerships validate age-appropriateness
- **Financial moat**: Edusave integration (competitors can't easily access)
- **Network effects**: More experts + educators + parents → better age templates → more adoption

---

## Slide 15 — Risks and mitigations

**Risk 1: Kickstarter campaign underperforms (<100 backers)**
- **Mitigation**: Pre-launch email list building (500–1,000 subscribers), early bird pricing, influencer partnerships
- **Contingency**: Extend campaign or pivot to pre-order model on own website

**Risk 2: Schools decline to participate in pilot**
- **Mitigation**: Target 3–5 schools (need only 1–2 to commit), leverage Kickstarter traction as proof
- **Contingency**: Pivot to pure B2C model and defer school partnerships to Phase 3

**Risk 3: Execution complexity (managing two cohorts simultaneously)**
- **Mitigation**: Clear channel separation, stagger timelines (Kickstarter Month 3–4, school pilot Month 4–6)
- **Contingency**: Delay school pilot to Month 5–7 and focus on Kickstarter fulfillment first

**Risk 4: Policy variability across schools**
- **Mitigation**: School templates + verifier (flexible policy engine)

**Risk 5: Bypass attempts** (VPN, hidden browsers, resets)
- **Mitigation**: Device Owner + allowlist + re-enrollment + hardening

**Risk 6: Support load**
- **Mitigation**: Limit device models, keep v1 app list minimal, build support automation
