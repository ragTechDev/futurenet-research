# Pilot Device Sourcing Options for Pre-Seed Round

**Document for**: FutureNet Phone Co-founders  
**Date**: January 2026  
**Context**: Cost optimization strategies for 100–150 device pilot

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines three device sourcing strategies for the pilot phase, comparing **new devices (S$170 COGS)**, **refurbished devices (S$80 COGS)**, and **donated devices (S$0 COGS)**. Using refurbished or donated devices for the pilot can reduce capital requirements by **S$40K–S$60K**, enabling either a smaller fundraise, higher founder salaries, or extended runway.

---

## Device Sourcing Options

### Option 1: New Devices (Baseline)

**Device COGS**: S$170 per unit (Samsung A-series + accessories)  
**Pilot inventory (100–120 units)**: S$17K–S$20.4K (devices only)  
**Total with accessories/packaging**: S$19K–S$23K

**Advantages**:
- Consistent hardware quality and warranty
- Zero-touch enrollment compatibility guaranteed
- Professional appearance for school partnerships
- Can transition pilot devices to paid customers post-pilot

**Disadvantages**:
- Highest upfront capital requirement
- Locks in significant capital in inventory
- Risk if pilot requires hardware pivots

**Best for**: Fundraise of S$350K+ with strong investor confidence

---

### Option 2: Refurbished Devices (Recommended for Pilot)

**Device COGS**: S$80 per unit (refurbished Samsung A-series)  
**Pilot inventory (100–120 units)**: S$8K–S$9.6K (devices only)  
**Total with accessories/packaging**: S$10K–S$12K

**Capital savings vs. new devices**: **S$9K–S$11K** (47% reduction)

**Advantages**:
- **Significant cost reduction** without compromising pilot validation
- Same Android OS and Knox compatibility as new devices
- Sufficient quality for 6–9 month pilot duration
- Reduces financial risk if pilot requires pivots
- Can still transition to new devices for commercial launch

**Disadvantages**:
- Potential variability in device condition (requires QA process)
- May have shorter warranty periods (6–12 months vs. 3 years)
- Slightly higher failure rate (estimate 8–10% vs. 5%)
- Less polished for school partnership presentations

**Sourcing considerations**:
- Singapore refurbished device suppliers: Carousell Business, Reebelo, Lazada Certified Refurbished
- Ensure devices support Samsung Knox and zero-touch enrollment
- Implement incoming QA process (battery health, screen condition, Knox compatibility)
- Budget additional 10% for replacements (12–15 extra units)

**Best for**: Capital-efficient pilot validation; fundraise of S$250K–S$350K

---

### Option 3: Donated Devices (Maximum Capital Efficiency)

**Device COGS**: S$0 per unit (donated by parents, schools, or corporate sponsors)  
**Pilot inventory (100–120 units)**: S$0 (devices only)  
**Total with accessories/packaging**: S$2K–S$3K (cases, screen protectors only)

**Capital savings vs. new devices**: **S$17K–S$20K** (100% reduction on devices)

**Advantages**:
- **Maximum capital efficiency** for pilot phase
- Demonstrates community buy-in and validation
- Enables smaller fundraise (S$200K–S$250K) or higher founder salaries
- Reduces inventory risk to near-zero
- Strong narrative for investors ("parents donated devices to participate")

**Disadvantages**:
- High variability in device models and conditions
- Complex logistics (collection, QA, provisioning)
- May not support zero-touch enrollment (requires manual provisioning)
- Difficult to ensure consistent pilot experience
- Less professional for school partnership presentations
- Cannot guarantee Samsung Knox compatibility across all models

**Sourcing strategies**:
1. **Parent donations**: Pilot families donate old Android phones (Samsung, Google Pixel) in exchange for discounted subscription
2. **School e-waste programs**: Partner with schools collecting old student devices
3. **Corporate sponsors**: Approach Samsung, Singtel, or tech companies for device donations/sponsorship
4. **Trade-in program**: Offer S$50–S$100 credit for donated devices that meet specs

**Feasibility considerations**:
- Requires 4–6 weeks lead time to collect sufficient devices
- Need strict device eligibility criteria (Android 11+, Samsung Knox support, <3 years old)
- Implement rigorous QA process to ensure pilot quality
- May need to supplement with refurbished devices to reach 100–120 units

**Best for**: Bootstrapped or very lean fundraise (S$200K–S$250K); strong community engagement

---

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Strategy**: Combine refurbished devices (primary) + donated devices (supplementary)

**Pilot inventory breakdown (120 units)**:
- **80 refurbished devices** @ S$80 = S$6.4K (core pilot fleet)
- **40 donated devices** @ S$0 = S$0 (supplementary fleet)
- **Accessories for all 120 units**: S$2.4K (cases, screen protectors)
- **Total device cost**: S$8.8K

**Capital savings vs. new devices**: **S$11.6K–S$14.2K** (55–60% reduction)

**Advantages**:
- Balances cost efficiency with quality control
- Refurbished devices ensure baseline quality and consistency
- Donated devices demonstrate community engagement
- Reduces risk of insufficient donated device supply
- Strong investor narrative (cost-conscious + community validation)

**Implementation**:
1. **Months 1–2**: Source 80 refurbished devices from certified suppliers
2. **Months 2–3**: Launch donation drive with pilot families and school partners
3. **Month 3**: QA all donated devices; accept 30–40 that meet specs
4. **Month 3–6**: Deploy 120 devices (80 refurbished + 40 donated) to pilot families

## Recommendation

**For pre-seed fundraise, we recommend: Scenario B (Hybrid: Refurbished + Donated)**

**Rationale**:
1. **Optimal cost/quality balance**: Refurbished devices ensure baseline quality; donated devices reduce cost
2. **Reduces fundraise requirement**: Can target S$280K–S$300K instead of S$350K
3. **Strong investor narrative**: Demonstrates capital discipline + community validation
4. **Lower risk than donated-only**: Refurbished devices provide consistent core fleet
5. **Enables higher founder salaries**: Savings can increase founder comp to S$3K–S$3.5K/month

**Implementation timeline**:
- **Month 1**: Source 80 refurbished devices from certified suppliers (Reebelo, Carousell Business)
- **Month 2**: Launch donation drive with pilot families and school partners
- **Month 3**: QA donated devices; accept 30–40 that meet specs (Android 11+, Knox support)
- **Month 3–6**: Deploy 120 devices to pilot families

**Fallback plan**: If donated device collection falls short, purchase additional 20–40 refurbished units (budget S$1.6K–S$3.2K from contingency)

## Impact on Founder Compensation

With S$11K–S$14K saved on device inventory, founders have three options:

### Option A: Reduce Fundraise Target
- Raise S$280K–S$300K instead of S$350K
- Maintain S$2.5K/month founder salaries
- Easier fundraise (lower dilution, smaller check sizes)

### Option B: Increase Founder Salaries
- Maintain S$350K raise target
- Increase founder salaries to S$3K–S$3.5K/month (from S$2.5K)
- Improves founder quality of life without sacrificing product/pilot budget

### Option C: Extend Runway
- Maintain S$350K raise and S$2.5K/month salaries
- Allocate savings to contingency buffer
- Extends runway from 9 months to 10–11 months

**Recommended**: **Option B** (increase founder salaries to S$3K/month)
- Still capital-efficient (23% of raise vs. 20%)
- Improves founder sustainability and reduces financial stress
- Maintains strong product/pilot budget
- Acceptable to pre-seed investors
