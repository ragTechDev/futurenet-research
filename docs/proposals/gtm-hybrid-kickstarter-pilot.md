# Go-to-Market Strategy: DTC-First with Parent Community

**FutureNet Phone Launch Plan**  
**Date**: January 2026  
**Strategy**: Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) launch focused on parent communities and word-of-mouth

---

## Executive Summary

FutureNet Phone will pursue a **DTC-first go-to-market strategy** focused on:
1. **Kickstarter campaign** (Months 1–4) to validate consumer demand and fund device inventory
2. **Parent community building** (Months 4–9) to scale through word-of-mouth and parent advisory board
3. **Regional expansion** (Months 9–18) to grow to 1,000+ devices and prepare for seed round

This approach delivers faster revenue validation, reduces VC dilution, and builds on parent trust rather than institutional dependencies.

**Key outcomes**:
- **Month 4**: First revenue from 150–250 Kickstarter backers (S$100K–S$150K)
- **Month 9**: 250–500 total devices deployed with strong parent testimonials
- **Month 18**: 1,000+ devices, positioned for seed round (S$1M–S$2M)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why DTC-first?

**Parents are familiar with managed devices (thanks to PLDs)**:
- Every secondary school student has a school-issued laptop/tablet for learning
- Parents understand the concept of managed devices for specific purposes
- **Gap**: PLDs are for learning, not communication; laptops/tablets, not smartphones
- Parents still need a **personal smartphone** for their child's communication, coordination, and safety

**Parents want parent-owned, parent-controlled devices**:
- PLDs are school-managed for in-school use
- FutureNet is **parent-managed for holistic child development** across the whole day
- Different focus: school hours, homework time, family time, sleep, social development
- Expert-backed by child & adolescent psychiatrists and cybersafety experts

**DTC-first advantages**:
- ✅ **Faster revenue validation** (3–4 months vs. 9–12 months for school partnerships)
- ✅ **Reduced VC dilution** (S$200K VC + S$125K Kickstarter = S$325K total)
- ✅ **Parent trust > institutional endorsement** (parents understand PLDs, want personal device)
- ✅ **Faster product iteration** (direct parent feedback, no school bureaucracy)
- ✅ **Built-in distribution** (Women Devs SG community, RagTech podcast, parent networks)
- ✅ **Lower execution complexity** (single channel focus)

**Why this works now**:
- Parents are exhausted with manual parental controls (hours of annual updates)
- No expert guidance on what's age-appropriate for teens
- International solutions (WisePhone, Sage, Bark) not available in Singapore
- Parents ready for expert-backed management (building on PLD familiarity)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Kickstarter campaign underperforms (<150 backers)

**Mitigation**:
- Pre-launch email list building (target 500–1,000 subscribers)
- Leverage Women Devs SG community (1,000+ members, many are parents)
- RagTech podcast episode to build awareness and trust
- Early bird pricing to drive urgency (50 units @ S$249)
- Influencer partnerships and PR seeding before launch

**Contingency**: If Kickstarter raises <S$75K, reduce cohort to 100–150 units and extend timeline for Phase 2 growth

---

### Risk 2: DTC sales slow after Kickstarter

**Mitigation**:
- Build parent advisory board for ongoing feedback and advocacy
- Strong referral program (S$20 credit for both parties)
- Continuous content marketing and parent testimonials
- Leverage Women Devs SG and RagTech networks for word-of-mouth

**Contingency**: If DTC sales <10 units/month, increase paid acquisition budget or explore retail partnerships earlier

---

### Risk 3: Parent feedback reveals product-market fit issues

**Mitigation**:
- Parent advisory board provides ongoing feedback loop
- Monthly check-ins to catch issues early
- Agile product iteration based on real usage data
- Direct parent communication (no institutional intermediaries)

**Contingency**: If major issues arise, pause DTC sales and focus on product refinement with advisory board

---

### Risk 4: Support load becomes unsustainable

**Mitigation**:
- Limit device models to reduce complexity
- Build support automation and self-service resources
- Keep v1 app catalog minimal (10–15 apps)
- Parent advisory board helps identify common issues early

**Contingency**: If support load >0.3 tickets/device/week, pause growth and hire part-time support staff

---
