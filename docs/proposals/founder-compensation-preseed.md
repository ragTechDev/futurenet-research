# Founder Compensation Strategy for Pre-Seed Round

**Document for**: FutureNet Phone Co-founders  
**Date**: January 2026  
**Context**: S$300K–S$400K pre-seed fundraising round

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines founder compensation options for our 3-person founding team (2 software engineers + 1 solutions engineer) during the pre-seed stage. The recommendation is to take **minimal survival salaries (S$2K–S$3K/month per founder)** to maximize capital efficiency while enabling full-time focus on product development and pilot execution.

---

## Founding Team

- **Co-founder 1**: Software Engineer
- **Co-founder 2**: Software Engineer  
- **Co-founder 3**: Solutions Engineer

**Total**: 3 full-time co-founders

## Compensation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lean/Bootstrap Mode (Maximum Capital Efficiency)

**Founder salaries**: S$0–S$2K/month each  
**Total annual burn on salaries**: S$0–S$72K (3 founders × S$2K × 12 months)

**Advantages**:
- Maximizes runway and capital available for product/pilot
- Strongest signal to investors (shows extreme commitment)
- Preserves full S$300K–S$400K for product development and pilot inventory

**Challenges**:
- Requires founders to have 6–9 months savings or side income
- May limit ability to focus 100% on FutureNet Phone
- Risk of burnout or financial stress

**Best for**: Founders with significant savings or who can maintain part-time consulting income

---

### Scenario 2: Survival Salary (Recommended)

**Founder salaries**: S$2.5K–S$3K/month each  
**Total burn for 9 months**: S$67.5K–S$81K

**Advantages**:
- Covers basic living expenses in Singapore (HDB rent, food, transport)
- Enables full-time focus without financial distraction
- Still capital-efficient (only 20–25% of raise goes to salaries)
- Acceptable to most pre-seed investors

**Trade-offs**:
- Reduces pilot device inventory slightly (100–120 units instead of 150)
- Less contingency buffer for unexpected costs

**Best for**: Founders committed to full-time work who need minimal income to cover living costs

**Singapore cost of living context**:
- Median fresh grad engineer salary: ~S$4K–S$5K/month
- Minimum viable living (HDB, food, transport): ~S$2K–S$3K/month
- S$2.5K/month = bare minimum but doable for committed founders

---

### Scenario 3: Market-Rate Salary (Not Recommended for Pre-Seed)

**Founder salaries**: S$6K–S$8K/month each  
**Total annual burn on salaries**: S$216K–S$288K

**Why not recommended**:
- Consumes 70–90% of raise, leaving insufficient capital for product and pilot
- Red flag for pre-seed investors (signals lack of capital discipline)
- Reduces pilot to <50 devices, making validation statistically weak
- Delays time-to-market and increases risk of running out of runway before seed round

**Only consider if**: Founders have critical financial obligations (mortgage, dependents) that cannot be deferred

---

## Recommended Approach: Scenario 2 with 6-Month Checkpoint

### Phase 1: Months 1–6 (Survival Salary)

**Founder compensation**: S$2.5K/month per founder  
**Total founder burn**: S$45K (6 months × 3 founders × S$2.5K)

**Capital allocation**:
- Leaves S$255K–S$355K for product development, pilot inventory, and operations
- Sufficient to build MVP and deploy 100–120 pilot devices

### Phase 2: Month 6 Checkpoint (Reassess Based on Traction)

**If pilot shows strong traction** (>70% conversion, school endorsement, >95% compliance):
- **Option A**: Raise seed round (S$1M–S$2M) and increase to market-rate salaries (S$6K–S$8K/month)
- **Option B**: Generate revenue from pilot families and self-fund modest salary increases (S$4K–S$5K/month)

**If pilot needs iteration** (lower conversion, school feedback requires pivots):
- **Option C**: Continue at survival rate (S$2.5K/month) for additional 3–6 months
- **Option D**: Seek bridge funding or extend runway through consulting/side projects

---

## Revised Use of Funds (with Scenario 2 Salaries)

Based on S$350K raise with S$2.5K/month per founder:

### Founder Salaries (20% / S$67.5K for 9 months)
- 3 founders × S$2.5K/month × 9 months = **S$67.5K**

### Product Development (35% / ~S$122.5K)
- Android launcher + School Mode + parent portal: S$80K–S$90K
- Compliance verifier + school templates: S$20K–S$25K
- Backend (enrollment, policy management, SOS): S$22.5K

### Pilot Inventory + Operations (30% / ~S$105K)
- Initial device inventory (100–120 units @ S$170 COGS): S$60K–S$70K
- MDM licenses + hosting (12 months): S$15K–S$20K
- Zero-touch enrollment setup + supplier relationships: S$15K
- Logistics + fulfillment infrastructure: S$15K

### Go-to-Market + Pilot Execution (10% / ~S$35K)
- School partnership development (1–2 pilot schools): S$20K
- Marketing materials + compliance documentation: S$8K
- Parent onboarding + support during pilot: S$7K

### Runway + Contingency (5% / ~S$17.5K)
- Support infrastructure + tooling
- Contingency for pilot learnings

**Total**: S$347.5K

## Alternative: Deferred Compensation Model

If founders want to maximize capital efficiency while still recognizing the value of their work:

**Structure**:
- Founders take S$0 salary during pre-seed (Months 1–6)
- Accrue deferred compensation at S$4K/month per founder
- Total deferred: S$72K (3 founders × S$4K × 6 months)

**Payment triggers**:
- **Trigger 1**: Seed round closes → pay out 50% of deferred compensation (S$36K)
- **Trigger 2**: First S$100K revenue → pay out remaining 50% (S$36K)
- **Trigger 3**: If neither trigger hits by Month 12 → convert to equity at seed round valuation

**Advantages**:
- Shows maximum commitment to investors
- Preserves full capital for product/pilot
- Founders still get compensated if company succeeds

**Risks**:
- Deferred compensation may never materialize if company fails
- Requires founders to have significant savings to cover 6+ months expenses

## Investor Expectations (Singapore Pre-Seed Context)

Based on typical Singapore pre-seed rounds:

**What investors expect**:
- Founders take **<30% of raise** for salaries at pre-seed stage
- Technical co-founders build product in-house (not outsourced)
- Capital primarily goes to product development, pilot inventory, and customer acquisition

**Red flags for investors**:
- Founders taking market-rate salaries (>S$6K/month) at pre-seed
- >40% of raise allocated to founder salaries
- Outsourcing core product development while paying founders high salaries

**Green flags for investors**:
- Founders taking survival salaries (S$2K–S$3K/month) or deferred compensation
- 60–70% of capital going to product and pilot
- Clear milestones tied to capital deployment

---

## Equity Considerations

While this document focuses on cash compensation, equity split should be discussed separately:

**Typical founding team equity splits**:
- **Equal split**: 33.3% / 33.3% / 33.3% (if all co-founders joined at same time with similar contribution)
- **Weighted by role**: 40% / 30% / 30% (if one co-founder is CEO or brought the idea/initial capital)
- **Vesting schedule**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (standard for all co-founders)

**Post-money equity after pre-seed**:
- Assuming S$350K raise at S$2M–S$3M pre-money valuation
- Investor ownership: ~12–15%
- Founder ownership: ~85–88% (diluted from 100%)

---

## Recommendation Summary

**For our 3-person founding team, we recommend**:

1. **Months 1–6**: Take S$2.5K/month per founder (S$45K total)
2. **Month 6**: Reassess based on pilot traction
3. **Months 7–9**: 
   - If strong traction → prepare seed round and increase salaries post-seed
   - If needs iteration → continue at S$2.5K/month or seek bridge funding

**Rationale**:
- Balances founder needs (basic living expenses) with capital efficiency
- Leaves sufficient capital (S$255K–S$305K) for product development and 100–120 device pilot
- Signals commitment to investors while enabling full-time focus
- Provides 6-month checkpoint to adjust based on real traction data

**Alternative if founders have savings**: Consider deferred compensation model (S$0 salary, accrue S$4K/month, pay out at seed round or revenue milestone)

## Next Steps

1. **Co-founder discussion**: Align on compensation approach (Scenario 1 vs. 2 vs. deferred)
2. **Personal financial planning**: Each co-founder assesses their runway and minimum viable income
3. **Investor pitch alignment**: Ensure use of funds in pitch deck reflects agreed compensation model
4. **Legal documentation**: Formalize compensation and equity agreements with co-founder vesting schedules

---

## Questions for Co-Founder Discussion

1. What is each co-founder's minimum viable monthly income to cover living expenses?
2. Do any co-founders have savings to support 6–9 months at S$0–S$2K/month?
3. Are there opportunities for part-time consulting income to supplement low/no salary?
4. What are the financial obligations (rent, dependents, loans) that constrain flexibility?
5. How do we feel about deferred compensation vs. immediate (but low) salary?
6. What is our shared commitment level to full-time focus vs. maintaining side income?
