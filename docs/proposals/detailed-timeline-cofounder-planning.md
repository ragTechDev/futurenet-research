## Summary: Cofounder Full-Time Transition Timeline

### Recommended Full-Time Transition Schedule

| Cofounder | Role | Full-Time Start | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cofounder 1** (Saloni) | Operations/Marketing Lead | **March 1, 2026** (Month 3) | Use March sabbatical for Kickstarter launch (most critical month). Consider continue full-time after sabbatical ends. |
| **Cofounder 2** (Natasha) | Growth/Partnerships Lead | **April 1, 2026** (Month 4) | School pilot recruitment and family onboarding requires full-time effort. |
| **Cofounder 3** (Victoria) | Product/Engineering Lead | **May 1, 2026** (Month 5) | School pilot support and relaunch preparation requires all hands on deck. |

### Alternative: Staggered Transition (Lower Risk)

If cofounders want to de-risk full-time transition:

| Cofounder | Role | Full-Time Start | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cofounder 1** | Operations/Marketing Lead | **March 1, 2026** (sabbatical) → **Return to part-time April** → **Full-time May 1** | Use sabbatical for Kickstarter, return to job, then quit in May for school pilot. |
| **Cofounder 2** | Growth/Partnerships Lead | **May 1, 2026** (Month 5) | School pilot requires full-time effort. |
| **Cofounder 3** | Product/Engineering Lead | **June 1, 2026** (Month 6) | Relaunch preparation requires full-time effort. |

**⚠️ Risk**: Staggered transition may slow momentum. Recommended to have at least 2 cofounders full-time by May for school pilot.

## Parallel Workstreams Summary

### Workstreams that can run in parallel:

1. **Product Development** (Software Engineer 1)
   - Knox prototype, age templates, compliance verifier
   - Can run independently, minimal dependencies

2. **Partnerships & Operations** (Solutions Engineer)
   - Expert partnerships, school recruitment, pilot management
   - Some dependency on product (need working prototype for demos)

3. **Marketing & Growth** (Software Engineer 2)
   - Kickstarter campaign, relaunch, investor relations
   - Dependency on product (need demo for Kickstarter video)

### Critical path dependencies:

1. **ACRA registration** → Samsung Business Account → Knox trial (Week 1-2, January)
2. **Knox prototype** → Kickstarter video → Kickstarter launch (Month 2-3)
3. **Kickstarter success** → School pilot credibility → School recruitment (Month 3-4)
4. **School pilot validation** → School endorsements → Relaunch (Month 5-6)
5. **Relaunch traction** → Seed round metrics → Fundraising (Month 7-9)

## Risks & Contingencies

### Risk 1: Samsung Knox trial approval delayed
- **Mitigation**: Apply for Samsung Business Account immediately after ACRA registration (Week 1)
- **Contingency**: Use alternative MDM (Google Workspace, Microsoft Intune) for prototype, migrate to Knox later

### Risk 2: Kickstarter campaign underperforms (<100 backers)
- **Mitigation**: Build email list to 500-1000 subscribers, pre-launch influencer partnerships
- **Contingency**: Extend campaign to 45 days, pivot to pre-order model on own website

### Risk 3: School recruitment fails (0 schools commit)
- **Mitigation**: Leverage Kickstarter traction as proof, target 5-10 schools (need only 1-2)
- **Contingency**: Pivot to pure B2C model, defer school partnerships to Phase 3

### Risk 4: Cofounder cannot go full-time due to financial constraints
- **Mitigation**: Close pre-seed round (S$250K) by March to fund founder salaries (S$3K/month each)
- **Contingency**: Staggered full-time transition (1 cofounder in March, 2nd in May, 3rd in June)

### Risk 5: School pilot fails (compliance <95%, NPS <50)
- **Mitigation**: Intensive support during pilot (all 3 cofounders full-time in May), iterate quickly
- **Contingency**: Extend pilot to 10-12 weeks, recruit additional schools, pivot messaging to B2C-first
