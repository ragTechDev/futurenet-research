https://doi.org/10.1111/bjdp.70006

## Key Frameworks

### UK ICO Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC)
Five developmental stages: 0-5, 6-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-17

### UNCRC Principle of Evolving Capacities
- Development is processual, variable, relational, and context-dependent
- Balance between protection and participation rights
- Enable children's exercise of rights as early as possible while maintaining protections
- Avoid rigid "bright-line" age limits in favor of nuanced, context-specific approaches

## Age Groups: Developmental Needs & Recommendations

### 0-5 Years: Pre-literate and Early Literacy

**Cognitive & Social Development:**
- Limited understanding of online risks
- Easily fooled by appearances
- Developing ability to "put themselves in others' shoes" (age 3-5)
- Unable to follow nuanced rules or make complex decisions
- Limited capacity for self-control or time management
- Pre-literate or early literacy stages

**Digital Behavior:**
- Adult-guided activities in "walled" environments
- Video streaming and simple games
- May use connected toys and voice-activated devices
- Often use parents' devices (may lack child-specific profiles)

**Recommendations:**
- **Parental consent required** for data processing (GDPR/DPA 2018)
- Design for pre-literate users (minimize text-based information)
- Provide adult-guided, highly protected environments
- Clear, simple rules and interfaces
- Strong default privacy and safety settings

### 6-9 Years: Core Primary School Years

**Cognitive & Social Development:**
- Developing basic understanding of privacy and obvious online risks
- Limited understanding of how personal data is used or less obvious risks
- Absorbing online safety messages from school
- Growing peer influence, but family remains strongest influencer
- Tend to comply with clear rules from home/school
- Variable literacy levels

**Digital Behavior:**
- Increasingly independent device use (often tablets)
- Preference for gaming, creative activities, and video streaming
- Experimenting with social aspects of games
- May set up social media accounts (despite age restrictions)
- Influenced by online vloggers

**Recommendations:**
- **Parental consent required** for data processing
- Clear, age-appropriate privacy education
- Simple explanations of data use and online risks
- Strong default protections with parental controls
- Consider video/visual content over text
- Design that accounts for variable literacy

---

### 10-12 Years: Transition Years

**Cognitive & Social Development:**
- Strong desire for immediate rewards (triggers risk-taking)
- Moving toward adult thinking but limited capacity for long-term consequences
- Impulsive behaviors and susceptibility to reward systems
- Increased peer pressure and "fear of missing out" (FOMO)
- Growing independence but still need parental support
- Better understanding of online environment, but unaware of complex data uses

**Digital Behavior:**
- **Major shift:** Likely to get own smartphone (especially transitioning to secondary school)
- Increased social networking and peer communication
- Online gaming with friends (pressure to play when others play)
- Susceptible to branding and online influencers
- Exploring self-identity online
- May prefer video content over text

**Recommendations:**
- **Parental consent required** (under age 13)
- Design that mitigates impulsive behaviors and reward manipulation
- Transparency about data use in age-appropriate language
- Tools to manage FOMO and time online
- Support for developing digital literacy
- Parental involvement tools (less directive than younger ages)
- Protection from persuasive design and dark patterns

**Note:** Age 12 in Scotland - presumed to have general understanding of data protection rights (s208 DPA 2018)

### 13-15 Years: Early Teens

**Cognitive & Social Development:**
- **Age 13: Can provide own consent** for data processing (UK GDPR)
- Strong need for peer identification and autonomy
- May reject or distance from parental values
- Tendency toward idealized/polarized thinking
- Susceptible to negative self-comparison
- May overestimate ability to cope with risks
- Developing emotional literacy but still maturing cognitively

**Digital Behavior:**
- Widespread social media use
- Gaming, video, and music streaming popular
- Seeking to emulate online influencers
- May use services parents don't know about or understand
- Use language/platforms parents may not understand

**Recommendations:**
- Enable consent at age 13 but with appropriate safeguards
- Design that supports healthy self-esteem and reduces harmful comparison
- Multiple support options beyond just parents
- Protection from manipulative design while respecting autonomy
- Tools for managing online relationships and conflicts
- Content moderation appropriate for developmental stage

**Gender-Specific Vulnerability Windows:**
- Females: Ages 11-13 show heightened sensitivity to social media effects
- Males: Ages 14-15 show heightened sensitivity to social media effects
- Both coincide with puberty timing

---

### 16-17 Years: Approaching Adulthood

**Cognitive & Social Development:**
- Reasonably robust online skills and coping strategies
- Still developing cognitively and emotionally (not adult-level resilience)
- Technical knowledge may exceed emotional literacy
- Capacity for long-term thinking still developing
- Risk-taking and impulsive behaviors continue
- Expect reasonable autonomy
- Pre-frontal cortex still developing (impulse control, emotional regulation)

**Digital Behavior:**
- Sophisticated digital engagement
- Social media, gaming, streaming widely used
- May view parental support as optional
- Expect to be treated with increasing autonomy

**Recommendations:**
- Respect autonomy while maintaining appropriate protections
- Provide multiple support options (not just parental)
- Design that acknowledges near-adult status but recognizes ongoing development
- Tools for managing complex online relationships and content
- Transparency about data use and algorithmic systems
- Support for transitioning to adult digital citizenship

## Critical Considerations

### Context Matters
- Development varies significantly across:
  - Geography and culture
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Individual circumstances
  - Gender
  - Disability and accessibility needs
- Western developmental norms should not be universally applied

### Research Gaps
- Limited evidence for younger children (especially 0-3)
- Lack of theory linking child development to digital experiences
- Small effect sizes in social media harm research
- Need for more cross-cultural research
- Offline vulnerabilities often mirrored online

### Policy Implications
- Avoid rigid "bright-line" age bans
- Age-appropriate design should be flexible and context-sensitive
- Balance protection with participation rights
- Enable positive rights as early as possible
- Extend protections as long as needed
- Consider individual variability within age groups

### Key Vulnerabilities Across Ages
- **Persuasive design and dark patterns** - all ages vulnerable, especially younger
- **Data collection and privacy** - younger children least aware
- **Peer pressure and FOMO** - peaks in transition years and early teens
- **Mental health impacts** - heightened during puberty (gender-specific windows)
- **Attention economy exploitation** - all ages, but younger children most vulnerable
- **Online relationships and bullying** - increases with age and social media use
