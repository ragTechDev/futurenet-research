# FutureNet Phone — Timeline Options (Feb 2026 - Jan 2027)

**Purpose**: Choose between two go-to-market strategies with clear timelines and resource requirements.

**Context**:
- **Team**: 3 cofounders (2 software engineers, 1 solutions engineer), currently working professionals
- **Sabbatical opportunity**: 1 cofounder has a month-long sabbatical in March 2026
- **Current status**: Business registered, ready to build
- **Decision needed**: Kickstarter-first vs Investment-first approach

---

## 🎯 Decision Framework: Which Path Should You Choose?

### Option A: Kickstarter-First (Community-Funded Launch)
**Best if you want to:**
- ✅ Validate market demand quickly with real customers
- ✅ Build community and early adopters before scaling
- ✅ Minimize dilution and maintain control
- ✅ Generate revenue before raising investment
- ✅ Prove traction to investors with real sales data

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Requires intense marketing effort in March-April
- ⚠️ 1 cofounder must go full-time in March (sabbatical)
- ⚠️ Fundraising happens later (Sept) with less runway
- ⚠️ Slower initial scale (100-200 units first)

**Key Milestone**: Launch Kickstarter in April, raise S$70K-110K from 100-200 backers

---

### Option B: Investment-First (Capital-Backed Launch)
**Best if you want to:**
- ✅ Secure runway and founder salaries upfront (S$250K-500K)
- ✅ Build more robust product before public launch
- ✅ Scale faster with capital for inventory and marketing
- ✅ Reduce personal financial risk for cofounders
- ✅ Hire support staff earlier

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Takes 2-3 months to close investment (Feb-Apr)
- ⚠️ Requires strong pitch and investor network
- ⚠️ More dilution upfront (10-20% equity)
- ⚠️ Less market validation before building
- ⚠️ Investor pressure and reporting requirements

**Key Milestone**: Close pre-seed round by April (S$250K-500K), launch DTC in June
