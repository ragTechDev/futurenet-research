# We Are Failing Teens in Digital Spaces

Looking into teens and their usage of technology. We realised:

They are not clueless.
They are not careless.
They are not asking for unlimited access.

According to the Pew Research Center, **38% of teens say they spend too much time on their smartphones**, even while acknowledging that being online helps them learn, connect, and express themselves.

That contradiction matters.

Because when the people inside a system recognize it is harming them, the problem is not awareness.
The problem is design.

## We Framed the Wrong Question

For years, we have asked one question over and over again.

“How much screen time is too much?”

But this question misses the point.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has made this clear for years. What matters is not just how long teens are on screens, but **what they are doing, when they are doing it, and what it is replacing**.

They recommend:
> “Reasonable but firm rules about media use, focusing on content, context, and balance rather than strict time limits.”

This is a fundamentally different way of thinking.

It shifts the conversation from control to structure.
From punishment to intention.
From fear to design.

## Teens Are Not Asking for Chaos

One of the most misunderstood things about teenagers is this.

They want freedom, but they also want boundaries.

Pew’s research shows that while many teens say their screen use is “about right,” a significant number admit they are online more than they would like. Some are already trying to reduce their social media use on their own.

That tells us something important.

Self-control alone is not a fair expectation in environments engineered for attention extraction.

We built digital systems optimized for engagement. We ourselves, as adults, are doomscrolling more often than we want to.
Then we blame teens for not resisting them.

## Parents and Schools Are Set Up to Fail

Parents are expected to manage devices that update faster than family rules. There's a new digital social app/trend popping up as we speak. 
Schools are expected to integrate technology while also protecting student wellbeing.

Pew reports that many parents attempt to limit phone use, struggle to enforce it consistently, and feel conflicted about privacy versus supervision.

This is not a parenting failure.
It is a systems failure.

We handed adults tools designed for consumption and asked them to retrofit safety onto them.

## Screen Time Is Not Neutral

Large-scale studies show that **higher daily screen use is associated with poorer mental health outcomes** among adolescents, including increased anxiety and depression. Teens reporting four or more hours of weekday screen time had significantly higher odds of these issues compared to peers with minimal screen use.

Importantly, the relationship is complex—screen use appears to affect wellbeing through multiple pathways (attention patterns, content exposure, social comparison, displacement of offline activities), not just sleep disruption alone.

At the same time, technology can be deeply positive when used with intention. Learning, creativity, connection, and support all live online too.

The difference is not the screen.
The difference is the environment around it.

## What Teens Actually Need

Research and lived experience point to the same conclusion.

Teens thrive in digital environments that offer:
- Predictable structure
- Clear boundaries
- Reduced visual and cognitive overload
- Calm, intentional interfaces
- Access to support when they need it
- Space to learn, not just consume

Safety should not feel like surveillance.
Boundaries should not feel like punishment.
Structure should feel like care.

## This Is a Design Responsibility

We would never build a physical space for teens without guardrails.
We would never design a school without hallways, schedules, or quiet zones.
We would never expect a teenager to navigate a city with no traffic rules.

Yet, that is exactly what we have done digitally.

We created powerful, addictive systems.
Then we asked teens to self-regulate inside them.

That is not realistic.
And it is not fair.

## Our Belief

Teen digital safety is not about taking devices away.
It is not about banning technology.
It is not about fear.

It is about **designing environments that respect attention, growth, and mental health**.

When we stop asking teens to fight the system and start fixing the system itself, everything changes.

This is not a moderation problem.
This is not a discipline problem.

This is a design problem.

And it is one we are responsible for solving.
