**We interviewed 9 parents about how tech is affecting their kids. Here's what keeps them up at night.**

As technologists behind ragTech and FutureNet, we've spent years talking about real life in tech. But along the way, we realized something critical: tech isn't just affecting us—it's fundamentally reshaping childhood.

So we did what researchers do: we asked questions. We sat down with 9 parents across different backgrounds, parenting styles, and tech comfort levels.

**What we discovered:**

🔓 **Controls are bypassable** – Kids find browser loopholes, switch accounts, and bypass restrictions faster than parents can set them up. Result? High monitoring burden and eroded trust.

😰 **Monitoring fatigue is real** – Parents face constant decision fatigue trying to enforce screen time limits while juggling work, sick kids, and their own need for downtime. Burnout is inevitable.

📱 **"Kids" platforms aren't trusted** – YouTube Kids, streaming services, and "family-friendly" apps are filled with ads (one parent called them "sewage"), algorithmic rabbit holes, and overstimulation.

🔄 **Peer exposure undermines home controls** – Harmful memes and content spread through school friends. Parents feel they "can't win" when kids are exposed through peers, not devices.

📊 **Social comparison warps self-esteem** – Curated content creates FOMO, anxiety, and compulsive checking behaviors that are hard to break.

🤖 **AI literacy is the new frontier** – Kids are using ChatGPT for homework without critical thinking skills. It's a new class of safety concern beyond content filtering.

**Here's the thing:** These aren't just pain points. They're design opportunities.
