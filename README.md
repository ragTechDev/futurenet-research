# FutureNet — Content Assessment Framework Research
*Building frameworks for age-appropriate content classification and online safety.*

FutureNet is a research initiative exploring content assessment frameworks for online safety and age-appropriate content classification. The purpose of this project is to **develop practical, evidence-based frameworks** that help regulators, platforms, educators, and parents create safer digital environments for children.

This project is part of the larger vision to build a **digital village (kampung)** for children — a safe environment that promotes responsible technological growth through effective content assessment and moderation.

## 🌱 Project Vision
FutureNet imagines a world where children use technology safely, supported by robust content assessment frameworks that balance protection with access to age-appropriate content.

From our research so far, we understand that content assessment needs vary drastically across age groups and contexts:

### Key Focus Areas

**Age-Appropriate Content Classification**
- Developing frameworks for assessing content suitability across age bands (5-8, 9-12, 13-16)
- Understanding developmental needs and risk factors at different ages
- Creating practical assessment criteria that platforms can implement

**Online Safety Assessment**
- Evaluating current content moderation approaches
- Identifying gaps in existing regulatory frameworks
- Researching AI-assisted content assessment tools
- Understanding platform safety mechanisms

**Stakeholder Collaboration**
- Engaging with regulators, platform providers, and safety experts
- Learning from international frameworks (IMDA, eSafety Commissioner, UNICEF)
- Incorporating perspectives from educators, parents, and advocacy groups

> *Effective content assessment requires collaboration between technology, policy, and child development expertise.*

### Research Approach

FutureNet explores:

- **Evidence-based frameworks** grounded in child development research
- **Practical assessment tools** that platforms and regulators can use
- **Multi-stakeholder engagement** to ensure diverse perspectives
- **International best practices** from leading regulatory bodies
- **AI and technology integration** for scalable content assessment

This repo contains research documentation, interview findings, and framework development work.

## 📅 Research Roadmap

FutureNet follows a phased research approach to develop evidence-based content assessment frameworks.

**Phase overview:**

- **Landscape Research**  
  Review existing content assessment frameworks from IMDA, eSafety Commissioner, UNICEF, and other regulatory bodies. Analyze current platform approaches to content moderation and age-rating.

- **Stakeholder Interviews**  
  Conduct interviews with regulators, platform providers, content safety experts, educators, and parent advocacy groups to understand needs, challenges, and opportunities.

- **Analysis & Synthesis**  
  Synthesize research findings to identify gaps in current frameworks, regulatory requirements, technical constraints, and opportunities for innovation.

- **Framework Development**  
  Develop draft content assessment frameworks, including criteria, tools, and implementation guidance for different stakeholder groups.

- **Validation & Refinement**  
  Engage experts and stakeholders to review and refine the framework, ensuring practical applicability and alignment with child rights principles.
